    According to the United States Census Bureau the world's population was
    about 7.55 billion in 2019 and that the 7 billion number was surpassed on
    12 March 2012. According to a separate estimate by the United Nations,
    Earth's population exceeded seven billion in October 2011, a milestone that
    offers unprecedented challenges and opportunities to all of humanity,
    according to UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. In this blog I will
    talk about population with the following points...

According to the United States Census Bureau the world's population was about
7.55 billion in 2019 and that the 7 billion number was surpassed on 12
March 2012. According to a separate estimate by the United Nations, Earth's
population exceeded seven billion in October 2011, a milestone that offers
unprecedented challenges and opportunities to all of humanity, according to
UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. In this blog I will talk about
population with the following points:
- World population
- Developing countries' population
- Developed countries' population

## World population

<p align="center">

</p>

This map presents the population of year 2018. It's a pity that the we don't
have data for some countries and regions. For the data that we have, China and
India have larger population than others; the population of countries like the
United States, Brazil and Russia is larger than half of other countries.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="World population and growth"

</p>

The graph above describes the world's total population and population annual
growth from 1960 to 2018. During nearly 60 years, total population increases
150%; especially between 1963 and 1973, the population annual growth is higher
than or equal to 2%, and keeps around 1.7% annual increase until 1990,
then the population increasing has slowed down since nearly 30 years, for the
last 8 years, the annual increase is around 1.2%. Next, I'll specify country's
population in terms of developing country and developed country.

## Developing countries' population

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Developing coutries population"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190913-population-developing-countries.png"/>
</p>

Among developing countries, the top 3 countries in terms of population are
China, India and Indonesia. The gap between Chinese population and Indian
population is increasingly smaller, the population of Indonesia is far from the
population of India.

### China
Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit
during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of
one child per family. Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the
unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions,
particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a "1.5"-child
policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one
child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December
2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child. In
2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a two-child policy. Data
from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may be around 1.4,
although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1.5–1.6.

According to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on
population growth or the size of the total population. However, these scholars
have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline
without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million
births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060
given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility
restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that
reduction.

### India
With 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census report,
India is the world's second-most populous country. Its population grew by
17.64% during 2001–2011, compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade
(1991–2001). The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females
per 1,000 males. The median age was 27.6 as of 2016. The first post-colonial
census, conducted in 1951, counted 361.1 million people. Medical advances made
in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought
about by the "Green Revolution" have caused India's population to grow rapidly.
India continues to face several public health-related challenges.

### Indonesia
The 2010 census recorded Indonesia's population as 237.6 million, with high
population growth at 1.9%.58% of the population lives in Java, the world's most
populous island. The population density is 138 people per km2 (357 per sq mi),
ranking 88th in the world, although Java has a population density of 1,067
people per km2 (2,435 per sq mi). The spread of the population is uneven
throughout the islands with a varying habitat and level of development, ranging
from the megalopolis of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in Papua. In 1961, the
first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people. It is
expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050. The
country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of
30.2 years (2017 estimate). About 8 million Indonesians live overseas; most
settled in Malaysia, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Hong
Kong, Singapore, the United States, and Australia.


## Developed countries' population

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Developed coutries population"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190913-population-developed-countries.png"/>
</p>

Among developed countries, the top 3 countries in terms of population are
United States, Japan and Germany. The population of the United States increases
continuously, so that it gets much much beyond Japan and Germany; however, the
population of Japan and Germany have kept nearly constant since 1990.

### United States
The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country's population to be 327,167,434 as
of July 1, 2018, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or
about 6,646 people per day.The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the
20th century, from 76.2 million in 1900 to 281.4 million in 2000. The third
most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is
the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are
projected. In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children; by the 1900s this
number had decreased to 3.56. Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been
below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.76 children per woman in 2017.
Foreign-born immigration has caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid
increase with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20 million in
1990 to over 45 million in 2015, representing one-third of the population
increase. In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born
children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) in the United States,
accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. The United States has a very
diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.
German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed
by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and
English Americans (circa 28 million).

White Americans (mostly European ancestry group with 73.1% of total population)
are the largest racial group; black Americans are the nation's largest racial
minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are
counted as an ethnic group, not a "racial" group), and third-largest ancestry
group. Asian Americans are the country's second-largest racial minority; the
three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino
Americans, and Indian Americans. According to a 2015 survey, the largest
American community with European ancestry is German Americans, which consists
of more than 14% of the total population. In 2010, the U.S. population included
an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native
ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some
native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively). The
census counted more than 19 million people of "Some Other Race" who were
"unable to identify with any" of its five official race categories in 2010,
over 18.5 million (97%) of whom are of Hispanic ethnicity.

### Japan
Japan is the second most populous island country with a population of 126.3
million (2019). 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019). Honshū is the
world's 2nd most populous island and it has 80% of Japan's population. Due to
the rugged and mountainous terrain with 66% forest, the population is clustered
in urban areas on the coast, plains and valleys. Japan is an urban society with
only 5% of the labor force working in agriculture. About 80 million of the
urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific coast of Honshu. In
2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.

The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018). It is part of
the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with
38,140,000 people (2016). The area is 13,500 km2 (5,200 sq mi) and the metro
area has a population density of 2,642/km2.

### Germany
With a population of 80.2 million according to the 2011 census, rising to at
least 81.9 million as of 31 December 2015, Germany is the most populous country
in the European Union, the second most populous country in Europe after Russia,
and the 16th most populous country in the world. Its population density stands
at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (588 per square mile). The overall life
expectancy in Germany at birth is 80.19 years (77.93 years for males and 82.58
years for females). The fertility rate of 1.41 children born per woman (2011
estimates), below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below
the high of 5.28 children born per woman in 1884, or 8.33 births per 1000
inhabitants, is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. Since the
1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is
witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the
2010s, particularly a rise in the number of well-educated migrants. Germany has
the 3rd oldest population in the world, with the average age of 47.4 years.

Four sizeable groups of people are referred to as "national minorities" because
their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries: There is
a Danish minority (about 50,000) in the northernmost state of
Schleswig-Holstein; the Sorbs, a Slavic population of about 60,000, are in the
Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg.; the Roma and Sinti live throughout
country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western
coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.

Approximately 5 million Germans live abroad (Auslandsdeutsche).
