The year 2020 is a year unlike any other for every one of us. This year, we
changed our working approach progressively; this year, most of us had more time
to accompany our family; this year, we paid more attention to hygiene.

This year I enhanced my knowledge of retailing, improved my python and analysis
by applying different projects. In the following, I’ll talk about:
- Working in retailing
- Self-learning
- COVID-19 analysis
- Second-hand apartments transactions in Paris & Ile-de-France
- Blogs

## Working in retailing
After 3.5 years' journey at Franprix, I started my adventure at "[In The Memory][Memory]"
since July of this year. I had a fruitful harvest by working at Franprix: I
founded the Data Science Team with another colleague after setting up an
infrastructure: Gitlab, e-mail reporting pipelines, and projects' management
tool; I entered the retailing world, saw its backstage, and understood how it
worked by creating and maintaining 30+ reports for directors and different
teams; learning and enhancing my skills in data engineering by automating ETL
processes (SQL, python, GitLab) that allowed to make it easier to wrangle data
and reduce time by as much as 50%; I also improved my analysis skill by applying
descriptive & predictive models and visualising data with suitable graphs via
python scripts to analyze products, clients' preferences and predict products'
sales.

[In The Memory][Memory] is a retail-tech company that helps retail players to
make the best use of the different internal and external data sources to meet
their strategic and operational business challenges. Our products allow
distributors and brands to accelerate their decision-making to attract more
customers and make the best assortment, merchandising, pricing and promotional
choices, in their various physical and online sales channels. We build tailored
Augmented Intelligence solutions to meet clients' priority challenges and serve
their strategies by supporting their teams in change management, defining
together the best KPIs to meet clients' challenges, and adapting our solutions
to the client's needs, constraints and processes.

We have 3 teams: consultants, data scientists and developers. The colleagues of
consultants team collects clients' needs, transcribes the technical view points
to discuss with the colleagues of data and dev team, to offer the solutions
which satisfy the clients' needs. For us data scientists, after discussing with
our retailing experts, we define strategic indicators, develop and implement
some algorithms with python and spark, then we'll present the KPIs and data
visualisation to the colleagues of the dev team, and to see if it's reasonable
and realizable for the platform.

The working atmosphere is amicably and dynamic, each week we have one meeting
within the whole company, another for each team, which allow everyone to well
know and follow all the projects (top transparency). Since mid-2020, we doubled
the number of employees! During my 6-month working at In The Memory, I got a
more global view of the retailing domain, enhanced my business thinking
according to multiple projects, like CRM and new feature creation for our
platform.

## Self-learning
This year I enriched my skills of extracting data via Google API. For example,
I learnt [how to get geographic information by Google Geocoding API][geocoding-api],
understood [how to get a YouTube video's information with YouTube Data API][YouTube-Data-API],
handled how to get places' reviews on Google Maps by [Place API][Place-API] and
[Google My Business API][GMB-API].

Before arriving at In The Memory, considering that I need to realise data
transformation with `pyspark`, I learnt how to manipulate data with it on
[datacamp][datacamp] and [applied that with docker][pyspark-docker].

</p>

Imagine that when we wrote a Python class to extract some business places’
reviews with Google Place API, how could we ensure that we will extract the
data correctly without sending requests to Google? In this case, I leart how to
[use python module `unittest` to mock][mock] a `requests.get` and to test if we
will get the expectant result. Mocking objects can simulate the behavior of
complex, real objects and are therefore useful when a real object is impractical
or impossible to incorporate into a unit test.

## COVID-19 analysis
As I mentioned at the beginning, our life is impacted by COVID-19. I did some
analysis for different continents, countries and cities with different
visualisations on multiple aspects: confirmed cases evolution, daily cumulative
confirmed count for each country, confirmed cases per 1 million people, deaths
rate, etc. You can find them all [here][tag covid-19].

## Second-hand apartments transactions in Paris & Ile-de-France
Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe’s major centers of finance,
diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts. According to the Economist
Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second
most expensive city in the world, after Singapore, and ahead of Zürich, Hong
Kong, Oslo, and Geneva. Another source ranked Paris as the most expensive, on a
par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018. All these elements help to bring the
increasing price of real estate in Paris. Thanks to the [open data source][dvf],
I went into them and found out the second-hand apartments transactions in
[Paris][dvf-Paris], [Ile-de-France][dvf-IDF] as well.

## Blogs
This year I wrote 24 blogs (including this one), they talk about various topics:
extracting data by Google APIs, data analysis, python application, unit test,
geovisualisation.  Moreover, the traffic of my blog increases by 233%
concerning 2019. I’m pretty glad if my blogs can help you and solve the problems
for you.

Don’t hesitate if you want to ask questions or write comments, it’s welcome!!

Happy New Year! Hope to see you in 2021!
