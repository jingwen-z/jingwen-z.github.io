A greenhouse gas (sometimes abbreviated GHG) is a gas that absorbs and emits
radiant energy within the thermal infrared range. Greenhouse gases cause the
greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water
vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. Without greenhouse
gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F),
rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F). The atmospheres of Venus,
Mars and Titan also contain greenhouse gases.

Human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (around 1750)
have produced a 45% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide
(CO2), from 280 ppm in 1750 to 415 ppm in 2019. This increase has occurred
despite the uptake of more than half of the emissions by various natural
"sinks" involved in the carbon cycle.

In this blog, I will talk about greenhouse gas emission with the following
points:
- Greenhouse gas emission
- CO2 emission

## Greenhouse gas emission

</p>

Greenhouse gases are those that absorb and emit infrared radiation in the
wavelength range emitted by Earth. In order, the most abundant greenhouse gases
in Earth's atmosphere are: Water vapor (H2O), Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane
(CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), Ozone (O3), Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
Hydrofluorocarbons (includes HCFCs and HFCs). Here, I have only emission data
of greenhouse gas, CO2, Methane and Nitrous oxide.

The contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is determined by the
characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may
cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about
84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time
frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct
radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime.
On the other hand, in addition to its direct radiative impact, methane has a
large, indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation.
Shindell et al. (2005) argue that the contribution to climate change from
methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect.

It is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of
the greenhouse effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit
radiation at the same frequencies as others, so that the total greenhouse
effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas. The higher ends of
the ranges quoted are for each gas alone; the lower ends account for overlaps
with the other gases. In addition, some gases, such as methane, are known to
have large indirect effects that are still being quantified.

Now let's look at the greenhouse gas emission. Greenhouse gas's emission
increased nearly 94% between 1970 and 2012, especially after 2001, it increased
33%. Among all greenhouse gas, CO2-emission quote-part is more than half of
greenhouse gas emission, we'll go deeper in the following part. However, the
emission of Methane and Nitrous oxide didn't increase that much. Since CO2's
emission is usually generated by burning fossil fuels, deforestation or
biological respiration, and the emission of Methane and Nitrous oxide is caused
by intestinal fermentation, combustion of organisms or fertilizer production,
which are less frequency.

## CO2 emission
Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere is a trace gas, at the mid 2018 having a
global average concentration of 409 parts per million by volume (or 622 parts
per million by mass). Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide fluctuate
slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and
summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter
as plants go dormant or die and decay. Concentrations also vary on a regional
basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft. In
urban areas concentrations are generally higher and indoors they can reach 10
times background levels.

</p>

The concentration of carbon dioxide has risen due to human activities.
Combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation have caused the atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide to increase by about 43% since the beginning
of the age of industrialization. Most carbon dioxide from human activities is
released from burning coal and other fossil fuels. Other human activities,
including deforestation, biomass burning, and cement production also produce
carbon dioxide. Human activities emit about 29 billion tons of carbon dioxide
per year, while volcanoes emit between 0.2 and 0.3 billion tons. Human
activities have caused CO2 to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of
thousands of years. Currently, about half of the carbon dioxide released from
the burning of fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere and is not absorbed by
vegetation and the oceans.

According to the graphs above, the world's CO2 emission increases 285% from
1960 to 2014, especially after 2000, it increases 46%. The top 3 countries in
2014 are China, United States and India. For United States and India, their
emissions increased gently; on the contrary, China's CO2 emission exceeded
United States and became the country whose CO2 emission is more than others.
Between 2000 and 2014, China's CO2 emission increases 200%, which corresponds
the world's emission curve.

Moreover, the world's CO2 emission per capita increases 61% from 1960 to 2014,
especially after 2000, it increases 22%. Similarly, I find out the top 3
countries are Qatar, Curacao and Trinidad and Tobago. Considering the
population per country, we observe that these 3 countries have pretty small
population, so it's not difficult to understand why their CO2 emission per
capita are more than other countries'.

(Yes, I only find data until 2014, it's really a pity, if you have found open
source data for recent years, it's welcome!!)

Although we lack data of some countries or regions, we can still find that the
CO2 emission doesn't change a lot for almost countries or regions and their CO2
emission is not that much in general; except for China, United States and
India, which correspond to the line charts above.

### China
In recent decades, China has suffered from severe environmental deterioration
and pollution. While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law
are fairly stringent, they are poorly enforced, as they are frequently
disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid
economic development. Urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the
country; the World Bank estimated in 2013 that 16 of the world's 20
most-polluted cities are located in China. And China is the country with the
highest death toll because of air pollution. There are 1.14 million deaths
caused by exposure to ambient air pollution. China is the world's largest
carbon dioxide emitter. The country also has significant water pollution
problems: 40% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and
agricultural waste by late 2011. In 2014, the internal freshwater resources per
capita of China reduced to 2,062m3, and it was below 500m3 in the North China
Plain, while 5,920m3 in the world.

However, China is the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its
commercialization, with \$52 billion invested in 2011 alone; it is a major
manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in
local-scale renewable energy projects. By 2015, over 24% of China's energy was
derived from renewable sources, while most notably from hydroelectric power: a
total installed capacity of 197 GW makes China the largest hydroelectric power
producer in the world. China also has the largest power capacity of installed
solar photovoltaics system and wind power system in the world. In 2011, the
Chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan (US$619
billion) in water infrastructure and desalination projects over a ten-year
period, and to complete construction of a flood prevention and anti-drought
system by 2020. In 2013, China began a five-year, US\$277 billion effort to
reduce air pollution, particularly in the north of the country.

### United States
The United States is the second largest contributor of carbon dioxide in the
world, releasing nearly 15% of global emissions. US residents emit
approximately 16.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide per capita every year.

The states like Wyoming, North Dakota and West Virginia produce high level of
CO2 emission. Wyoming is the second largest producer of electricity in the
country and it has a high energy intensity rating, which means it has a high
amount of energy consumed per gross domestic product. These factors work
together to give Wyoming the highest per capita carbon dioxide emission rate in
the country. North Dakota also has a high energy intensity rating, and it
experiences extremely cold winters, which creates an increased demand for
heating and energy. For West Virginia, one of the factors contributing to this
high rate is the state's reliance on fossil fuels to produce energy.
Approximately 98% of its energy comes from the following fossil fuels: coal
(77%), natural gas (12.8%), and oil (8.6%).

## Conclusion
Should greenhouse gas emissions continue at their rate in 2019, global warming
could cause Earth's surface temperature to exceed historical values as early as
2047, with potentially harmful effects on ecosystems, biodiversity and human
livelihoods. At current emission rates, temperatures could increase by 2 °C,
which the United Nations' IPCC designated as the upper limit to avoid
"dangerous" levels, by 2036.
