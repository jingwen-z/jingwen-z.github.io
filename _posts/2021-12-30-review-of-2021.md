## Introduction
The year 2021 is still a year battling with COVID-19. Thanks to the vaccination,
our life gradually returns to normal, we started to back to the office more
frequently and had the chance to travel as before. This year I continue to go
deeper on how to apply data science to the retailing domain and do some data
analysis with open-source data as well. In this blog, I'll resume my year of
2021 with the following points:
- Working in retailing (In The Memory)
- COVID-19 analysis
- Blogs

## Working in retailing (In The Memory)
[In The Memory][Memory] is a retail-tech company that helps retail players to
make the best use of the different internal and external data sources to meet
their strategic and operational business challenges. Our products allow
distributors and brands to accelerate their decision-making to attract more
customers and make the best assortment, merchandising, pricing, and promotional
choices, in their various physical and online sales channels. We build tailored
Augmented Intelligence solutions to meet clients' priority challenges and serve
their strategies by supporting their teams in change management, defining
together the best KPIs to meet clients' challenges and adapt our solutions to
the client's needs, constraints and processes. Moreover, this year, we have won
the "Pépite du Retail 2020" trophy, voted for by LSA Live participants and was
elected best Microsoft 2021 partner in the "France Action Startup Award"
category; we have nearly 50 colleagues vs. 25 in 2020.

### What did I do during working?
This year I accomplished about twenty CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
projects, some are for the distributors, some are for the industrialists. With
our analysis, we help them to have 10% more turnover per client. I also
developed new features for a module that can extract about 50 KPIs for 1 year
for different levels, such as per product/store, per product category/store
group, or temporal levels x product/store, like month x product or day x store,
etc. The SLA (Service-Level Agreement) of this module is about 2-5 min, and
during 2 weeks after the release, the module has already been used around 1500
times. Moreover, with my colleague, we created a model for estimating the
product's turnover and recommend products for different promotion operations,
which will be applied in a new module. Since it's confidential, I won't talk
about the details here ;)

Furthermore, as the company expands, we updated our information on [Welcome to
the Jungle][wttj]. I participated in a [video shooting][wttj-video] for
presenting what the data team does in daily work and how we cooperate with other
teams like consulting team and dev team.

### What did I learn during working?
Working in different projects of retailing, I gained more knowledge of [different][part1]
[indicactors][part2]. Thanks to the CRM projects, I understand what should we
focus on according to clients' needs and [how to segment customers with their purchases][blog-crm].
During the daily work, I learned how to cut a project and accomplish different
parts of the project with colleagues. The biggest gain is that when I did the
sales promotion project, I enriched my knowledge of promotion, I understood
different promotions operate different mechanics and generosities; to define
the products for each promotion, we need to reach various objectives, such as
the turnover objective, product number, brand type distribution, generosity
distribution, etc. Thanks to this project, I have closer contact with the people
of business (category managers, purchase, promotion, etc.), which let me better
understand their needs/pain points, so that we can develop the right product to
satisfy the needs or solve the pain points.

## COVID-19 vaccine analysis
Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with
the COVID-19 virus, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. To
achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be
vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of
social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped.
And a vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much
wisdom and effort of scientists.

With open-source datasets, I analyzed the adverse reactions of Pfizer vaccine,
Coronavac vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine and Modena vaccine in different blogs:

- [Do you know the reactions of Pfizer vaccine?][b1]
- [Do you know the reactions of Coronavac vaccine?][b2]
- [Do you know the reactions of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine?][b3]
- [Do you know the reactions of Modena vaccine?][b4]
- [Do you know which COVID-19 vaccine brings the most obvious reactions?][b5]

<p align="center">

</p>

Whether it is a local reaction or a systemic reaction, the reaction is most
obvious after the injection of Modena. 86% of people have local reactions, such
as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site, and nearly 67% have a
systemic reaction. Such as fatigue, chills, joint pain, muscle pain, etc.
Followed by the Kexing vaccine, 62% of people had a local reaction after
injection, and 58% had a systemic reaction. Among the four vaccines, the
Pfizer-Biotech vaccine caused the least adverse reactions. The probability of
local and systemic reactions after vaccination was 29.5% and 22.4%, respectively.

## Blogs
This year I wrote 22 blogs (including this one), they talk about various topics:
retailing, COVID-19, population and employee. Moreover, the traffic of my blog
increased by 21.4% concerning 2020. I’m pretty glad if my blogs can help you and
solve the problems for you.

</p>

Besides, I opened a Wechat Official Account, which is likely a personal blog
based on Wechat. On this platform, I translated some of my English blogs into
Chinese ones and shared them with my Chinese friends. I've written 11 blogs
and they've been read for 8500 times.

Don’t hesitate if you want to ask questions or write comments, it’s welcome!!

Hope to see you in 2022!
