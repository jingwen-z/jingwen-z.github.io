Year 2018 comes soon, at the tail of 2017, I would like to review the whole year,
sum up both professional gains and self-learning gains. This year is a turning
point in my life: I finished my study in school and entered the workplace. Thanks
to the rich education of [Toulouse School of Economics][TSE] and the trust of my
lead, I did my modest part to contribute [franprix][franprix] as a Data Scientist.

In franprix, I play a role as a "full stack" data scientist, which means when I
put my hands to a new project, I do ETL(Extract-Transform-Load), data cleaning,
data visualisation, create model, apply algorithm, analyse and give a
presentation to requesters all by myself. Not easy for a junior, but I really
enjoy it and learnt lots of new things in technology, I know how to communicate
with my colleagues and organise time when I have a new project. In the following,
I'll go into detail.

## Technology

### Projects at franprix

</p>

In this year, I studied many interesting subjects. In order to find the impact
of weather on sales, I created a linear regression, which can specify the impact
of weather on each subfamily. We found various effects of weather, for instance,
in this graph, the blue line means the tendency of daily average precipitation,
the orange one presents daily volume of women's umbrella, the purple one shows
daily volume of men's umbrella. We can easily find that the effect of
precipitation on women's umbrella is more than the effect on men's umbrella. Now,
let's see the detail. When precipitation increases 1 mm, 6 more women's
umbrellas will be sold; if it rains, 11 more women's umbrellas will be sold.
However, nearly 3 more men's umbrella can be sold once precipitation increases
1 mm; only 3 more men's umbrella can be sold if it rains.

In order to help merchandise team to organise the shelves, I used apriori
algorithm analysed consumers' preference, determined the shelves that often sold
together, and found the association between each two shelves. This graph shows
some attractive results, like sweet biscuits are associated with cereals and
bars, chocolate confectionery, rusks and chocolates in tablets; non-alcoholic
drinks can bring together with spirits, chips, dry sausages and salty aperitif;
and meats are related with dry sausages and sea caterers.

</p>

Moreover, CEO likes to know the sale of franprix-producing juice, baguette and
rotisserie, in terms of hour. For making the report more clear to read, I used
[Microstrategy][Microstrategy] to visualise the data, as the graph above. From
the graph we can observe not only the total sale of 3 shelves products per hour,
but also the detail for each store, which can satisfy different needs.

</p>

Furthermore, we also helped HR Department. As enterprise growing, there are more
and more shops spread all over France, so are its employees. Some employees take
such a long duration for working and going home. To facilitate the way between
one’s home and workplace(shop), CEO proposed that 2 employees can exchange their
workplaces, if it saves time for both. This project is for finding the optimal
solution for all employees. We combined R and Google Maps API, created a tool
for visualising and simplifying the employee-switching. Voilà, like this graph,
we can enter an employee ID and click "choice 1", then his domicile and
workplace position will display on the map, the best switch for him as well; it
will also display the distance and duration for arriving the new workplace.

Here I just show you the most interesting projects of this year, we also achieved
many other projects like automating creation of report and sending e-mail by
[Talend][Talend], visualising data by Microstrategy, analysing stores'
performance, analysing tourist-area stores, etc.

### Self-learning

<p align="center">
  <img alt="learning on datacamp"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20171222-datacamp.png"/>
</p>

As a data scientist, we should never stop learning new things(languages,
technologies, algorithms). In this year, I participated Microstrategy's formation
and learnt how to make a clear and simple visual report with its tools, and
continue to participate online courses. Thanks again to [datacamp][datacamp], I
started to learn basic knowledge of Python. I also learnt linear regression,
ridge regression, lasso and logistic regression in books "Introduction to
Machine Learning with Python" and "Python Machine Learning Cookbook".

</p>

Besides python, I learnt a new framework, git, on youtube. [Git][Git] is a
version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating
work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code
management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes
in any set of files[1]. Thanks to the videos, I learnt that `merge` means from
the chosen branch switch to the current HEAD branch, when there are merge
conflicts, you can UNDO a merge(`abort`) and start over; `rebase` is like an
alternative to merge, we should use `rebase` only locally on unpublished
commits, and never rebase commits that have already been pushed to a remote
repository. If you're interested for the details, you will find more things on
[youtube][Tower] and [Git documentation][git doc].

Moreover, I keep learning R this year, not only on datacamp, but also reading
a book named "R IN ACTION". By reading it, I strengthened basic knowledge of R,
like data structures, simple visualisation, also enrich my knowledge reserve of
machine learning. I learnt more about OLS regression models, using regression
diagnostics to assess the data's fit to statistical assumptions, and methods for
modifying the data to meet these assumptions more closely; I looked at how to
create time series in R, assess trends, examine seasonal effects, and considered
two of the most popular approaches to forecasting: exponential models and ARIMA
models; I understand the logistic regression is a type of generalized linear
model to predict a binary outcome from a set of numeric variables; I know that
decision trees involve creating a set of binary splits on the predictor
variables in order to created a tree that can be used to classify new
observations into one of two groups. All these algorithms helped our team on
different projects.

Apart from participating online courses and reading books, I also joined
technical meetups and exchanged ideas and technologies with others.

## Communication

Besides technical progress, I got some tips on communicating with my colleagues.
During our first discussion on a new project, I used to asking their objective,
the problems they met, project's deadline and all elements for the project. Then
thinking about its feasibility, possible duration and give requesters the first
response on project planning, so that we can assure the deadline according to
our ability.

## Time planning

Since there are lots of projects to analyse, we need to well organise our time
for being efficient. Everyday before leaving for home, I write a todo list for
tomorrow on my agenda, it can remind me the tasks immediately when I arrive at
my office the next day. How to make myself to be efficient? Besides listing tasks
on my agenda, I also organise the duration for each task. For the latter, I
follow [Pomodoro Technique][Pomodoro Technique] with a tool named
[Pomotodo][Pomotodo], I assign time-consuming of each task to several pomodoro,
and keep focused during each pomodoro. It works pretty well for me.

## Self-examination

Sometimes we can't avoid taking a roundabout course in our work. Under these
circumstances, I always asked myself the reason, why I misguided? What leads it?
What should I notice in the following projects? Persisting in so doing, this
kind of self-examination helps me to go forward faster.

## Leadership

Apart from working in data science, I also have chance to recruit my own
trainees. It's really an amazing experience, I applied for a job one year ago,
but this time I sat on the other side of table and interviewed my trainee
candidates. By this chance, I understand better what company thinks, emphasizes
and expects. Today I'm responsible of 2 trainees, thankfully, they help me a lot.

As growing of team, we need tools to manage our codes and projects. For code
management, the first idea came into my mind is Git, because it's a version
control system and suitable for coordinating work, and we can also review codes
for each other, it's good for our team and ourselves. Considering the security,
we decided to install gitlab in our server. For project management, we need a
tool to assign projects to different people, separate a whole project into small
parts and track progress. Finally we chose [freecamp][freecamp] because it's
simple and clear to use, all its functions satisfy our need.

## Sports

Well, besides learning technology, I did sports because it's good to health and
health is important for learning. This year I participated and finished Paris
Marathon, it's my third marathon. Voila, here is the medal:

Looking back this year, I learnt many things on different aspects. Hope it will
be better in 2018. Happy new year!
