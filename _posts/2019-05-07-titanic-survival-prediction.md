## Project understanding
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in
history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after
colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This
sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better
safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there
were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some
element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were
more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the
upper-class.

## Objectif
In this challenge, we need to analyse what sorts of people were likely to
survive. In particular, we also need to apply the tools of machine learning to
predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

=> There are missing data in "Age", "Cabin" and "Embarked", especially "Cabin"
whose 77% data are missing. So we will ignore it during the analysis.

What should we do on missing data of "Age"? We might replace null by median
age. Same for "Embarked"

=> On average, the probability of one passenger being survived is 38%.

## Data cleaning
{% highlight python %}
train_df['Embarked'].value_counts()
# S    644
# C    168
# Q     77
# Name: Embarked, dtype: int64

train_df['Age'].fillna(train_df['Age'].median(), inplace=True)
train_df['Embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)

## Data analysis
### Correlation matrix between numerical values and "Survived"

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Correlation heatmap"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-corr-heatmap.png"/>
</p>

According to this correlation heatmap, we find that "Survived" possibility is
slightly negative correlated with "Age", which means that the older the
passenger is, the more possible he will be survived; it's significant at 5%.
"Pclass" and "Fare are negatively correlated which is logic: the better class
is, the more expensive fare is. "Pclass" is also negative correlated with
"Survived" possibility, maybe the top class's location is nearer to exit?

### SibSp vs. Survived

<p align="center">
  <img alt="SibSp vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-sibsp-survived.png"/>
</p>

Most of survived people didn't have siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic,
other survived majority is people who had one sibling / spouse aboard the
Titanic. Very few people who had more than one sibling / spouse aboard the
Titanic were survived, since it's difficult to survive all passengers.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="SibSp & Sex vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-sibsp-sex-survived.png"/>
</p>

Among all survivals, the majority was female.

### Parch vs. Survived

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Parch vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-parch-survived.png"/>
</p>

Similarly as relation between SibSp vs. Survived, most of survived people did
not have parents / children aboard the Titanic, other survived majority is
people who had one parent / child aboard the Titanic. Very few people who had
more than one parent / child aboard the Titanic were survived, since it's
difficult to survive all passengers.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Parch & Sex vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-parch-sex-survived.png"/>
</p>

Among all survivals, the majority was female.

### Age vs. Survived

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Age vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-age-survived.png"/>
</p>

"Age" distribution is nearly a Normal distribution. We find that the most
survived are the people around 25 year-old, which might because there were lots
of younger on the board. However, people older than 50 year-old is less
survived, which is not exactly same as analysis above. The graph below will
explain why.

### Age vs. Sex vs. Survived

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Age vs. Sex vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-age-sex-survived.png"/>
</p>

According to this plot, we find that both female and male passengers are nearly
half survived, since the shadow surface of "Survived" and "Non-survived" are
nearly the same. But the survived possibility is different on ages for female
and male. For female passengers, the ones that older than 27 year-old have a
little bit more chance to be survived than others. For male passengers, the one
who is younger than 15 years old or older than 34 years old are more likely to
be survived than men between 16 and 32 years old, which because they help other
passengers to be alive.

Moreover, let's pay attention to the passengers that were older than 50
year-old. According to the graph "Age vs. Survived" we find that people older
than 50 year-old is less survived, which is not exactly same as correlation
analysis. But from this graph we can easily understand why: most of older
passengers were male, most of the older survival were female, and they were
nearly all survived. So in fact, older female passengers had much more chance
to be survived than older male passengers.

### Pclass vs. Survived

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Pclass vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-pclass-survived.png"/>
</p>

For the class of survived passengers, it's almost same for each class, the
possibility for class 1 is a bit more higher than others. However, non-survived
probability of class 3 is 3 times of class 1 and class 2, respectively. This is
coherent with analysis above.

### Embarked vs. Survived

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Embarked vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-embarked-survived.png"/>
</p>

Passengers who came from Cherbourg (`Embarked='C'`) had more chance to be
survived, so we'll study why they were most survived in the following.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Embarked & Pclass vs. Survived"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-embarked-pclass-survived.png"/>
</p>

According to this graph, we find that the majority of passengers came from
Southampton (`Embarked='S'`) and lots of them chose class 3 which decrease the
survived chance. However, the majority of passengers who came from Cherbourg
(`Embarked='C'`) were in class 1, such their chance to be survived was more
than others, which is coherent with result above.

## Train model
I trained data with SVM (Support-vector machine), Decision Trees, Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting and
Voting classifier (hard and soft), and compared their accuracy score:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Accurcy score"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190507-accuracy-score.png"/>
</p>

Finally I chose soft voting classifier in order to avoid the overfitting and
applied it to predict survivals in test dataset.

You can find all codes in [this notebook][notebook].
