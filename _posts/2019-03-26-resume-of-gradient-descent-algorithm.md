_Gradient Descent_ is a very generic optimization algorithm capable of finding
optimal solutions to a wide range of problems. The general idea of Gradient
Descent is to tweak parameters iteratively so that we can minimize a cost
function. An important parameter in Gradient Descent is the size of the steps,
determined by the learning rate hyperparameter. In this blog, I will talk about
how to determine the the size of the steps in different case with following
models:
- Batch Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Mini-batch Gradient Descent
- Comparison

## Batch Gradient Descent
To implement Gradient Descent, you need to compute the gradient of the cost
function with regards to each model

This is called a _partial derivative_.

Partial derivatives of the cost function:

</p>

Notice that this formula involves calculations over the full training set X, at
each Gradient Descent step! That is why the algorithm is called _Batch Gradient
Descent_: it uses the whole batch of training data at every step.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent
The main problem with Batch Gradient Descent is the that is uses the whole
training set to compute the gradients at every step, which makes it very slow
when the training set is large. At the opposite extreme, _Stochastic Gradient
Descent_ just picks a random instance in the training set at each step and
computes the gradients based only on the single instance.

Randomness is good to escape from local optima, but bad since it means that the
algorithm can never settle at the minimum. One solution is to gradually reduce
the learning rate. The steps start out large, then get smaller and smaller,
allowing the algorithm to settle at the global minimum. However, if you want to
be sure that the algorithm goes through every instance at each epoch, another
approach is to shuffle the training set, go through it instance by instance,
then shuffle it again, and so on.

To perform Linear Regression using SGD with Scikit-Learn, we can use the
`SGDRegressor` class, which defaults to optimizing the squared error cost
function.

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor

X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.rand(100, 1)

# 50 epochs, learning rate = 0.1
sgd_reg = SGDRegressor(n_iter=50, penalty=None, eta0=0.1)
sgd_reg.fit(X, y.ravel())
sgd_reg.intercept_, sgd_reg.coef_
# (array([4.16782089]), array([2.72603052]))
{% endhighlight %}

The code above runs 50 epochs, starting with a learning rate of 0.1, using the
default learning schedule and it doesn't use any regularization.

## Mini-batch Gradient Descent
Once you know Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent, it's
really simple to understand _Mini-batch Gradient Descent_: at each step,
instead of computing the gradients based on the full training (like Batch
Gradient Descent) set or based on just one instance (like Stochastic Gradient
Descent), Mini-batch Gradient Descent computes the gradients on small random
sets of instances called _mini-batches_. The main advantage of Mini-batch
Gradient Descent is that you can get a performance boost from hardware
optimization of matrix operations.

## Comparison
Let's compare the algorithms we've discussed, _m_ is the number of training
instances, _n_ is the number of features.

|Algorithm|Large m|Out-of-core support|Large n|Hyperparams|Scaling required|Scikit-Learn class|
|:-------:|:-----:|:-----------------:|:-----:|:---------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|
| Normal Equation | Fast | No | Slow | 0 | No | `LinearRegression` |
| Batch GD | Slow | No | Fast | 2 | Yes | n/a |
| Stochastic GD | Fast | Yes | Fast | >= 2 | Yes | `SGDRegressor` |
| Mini-batch GD | Fast | Yes | Fast | >= 2 | Yes | `SGDRegressor` |

## Conclusion
In this blog, I resumed characteristics of 3 different Gradient Descent
algorithms: Batch Gradient Descent computes the gradients based on the full
training set, it takes long time; Stochastic Gradient Descent picks just one
instance of training set, it has a better chance of finding the global minimum
than Batch GD; Mini-batch Gradient Descent computes the gradients on small
random sets of instances, it get a performance boost from hardware optimization
of matrix operations. Hope it's useful for you.
