When we say "distance", what do you think about? The distance between your home
and your workplace? What is the shortest distance to arrive somewhere? In this
blog, I will talk about how we apply distance in Data Science with the
following points:
- Haversine distance
- Real distance
- Use cases

## Haversine distance
### What is Haversine distance?
Here, Haversine distance also means great-circle distance, which is the
shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, measured along
the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight line through the sphere's
interior). The distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of
a straight line between them, but on the sphere there are no straight lines. In
spaces with curvature, straight lines are replaced by geodesics. Geodesics on
the sphere are circles on the sphere whose centers coincide with the center of
the sphere, and are called great circles.

### How to calculate Haversine distance in math?
An illustration of the central angle, _Δσ_, between two points, _P_ and _Q_.
_λ_ and _φ_ are the longitudinal and latitudinal angles of _P_ respectively.

Let <img alt="lambda_1" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\fn_phv&space;\lambda&space;_{1}"/>,
<img alt="phi_1" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\fn_phv&space;\phi&space;_{1}"/>
and <img alt="lambda_2" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\fn_phv&space;\lambda&space;_{2}"/>,
<img alt="phi_2" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline&space;\fn_phv&space;\phi&space;_{2}"/>
be the geographical longitude and latitude in radians of two points 1 and 2,
and _Δλ_, _Δφ_ be their absolute differences; then _Δσ_, the central angle
between them, is given by the spherical law of cosines if one of the poles is
used as an auxiliary third point on the sphere:

### How to calculate Haversine distance in Data Science?
Before running, we need to install `haversine` module.

{% highlight python %}
>>> from haversine import haversine

>>> haversine((48.856614, 2.3522219), (43.60426, 1.44367))
588.1899001977165 # Haversine distance between Paris and Toulouse
{% endhighlight %}

## Real distance
### What is Google Distance Matrix API?
For the real distance between two locations, I usually use the
[Google Distance Matrix API][r2], which is a service that provides travel
distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations, based on the
recommended route between start and end points.

We access the Distance Matrix API through an HTTP interface, with requests
constructed as a URL string, using origins and destinations, along with your
API key. The following example requests the distance matrix data between
Washington, DC and New York City, NY, in JSON format:

{% highlight python %}
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?units=imperial&origins=Washington,DC&destinations=New+York+City,NY&key=YOUR_API_KEY
{% endhighlight %}

### How to use Google Distance Matrix API in Data Science?
I saved my Google Distance Matrix API key in a `.properties` file, named as
"key.properties" in advance. Then I created a function
`get_itinerary(origin_lat, origin_lng, dest_lat, dest_lng)` to get distance
and duration between 2 locations.

{% highlight python %}
import configparser
from urllib.parse import urlencode
import requests

def get_itinerary(origin_lat, origin_lng, dest_lat, dest_lng):
    config = configparser.ConfigParser()
    config.read('key.properties')
    key = config['google']['data.science']

    origin = '%f, %f' % (origin_lat, origin_lng)
    destination = '%f, %f' % (dest_lat, dest_lng)

    response = requests.get(
        'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?language=en&' +
        urlencode({'origins': origin,
                   'destinations': destination,
                   'mode': 'driving',
                   'key': key}))
    distance_info = response.json()

    try:
        if distance_info['rows'][0]['elements'][0]['status'] == 'OK':
            duration = distance_info['rows'][0]['elements'][0]['duration'][
                           'value'] / 60
            distance = distance_info['rows'][0]['elements'][0]['distance'][
                           'value'] / 1000
            return [duration, distance]
        else:
            return ['', '']
    except IndexError:
        print('Failed to get status, response:', distance_info)
        raise
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, I choose driving mode with `'mode': 'driving'`, you can modify
the mode as you need.

## Use cases
### Stores geolocation
We have latitude and longitude for each store in our internal system, but some
are not that exact, so we decide to check and update geolocation's information
for each store, and specify the haversine distance between geolocation of
internal system and new defined geolocation.

### Exchange of employees' workplaces
As enterprise growing, there are more and more shops spread all over France, so
are its employees. Some employees take such a long duration for working and
going home. To facilitate the way between one’s home and workplace, CEO
proposed that 2 employees can exchange their workplaces, if it saves time for
both. This project is for finding the optimal solution for all employees. We
applied Google Distance Matrix API, created a tool for visualising and
simplifying the employee-switching. As the graph below, we can enter an
employee ID and click “choice 1”, then his domicile and workplace position will
display on the map, the best switch for him as well; it will also display the
distance and duration for arriving at the new workplace.

## Conclusion
In this blog, I talked about how to apply haversine distance and real distance
with `haversine` python module and Google Distance Matrix API. Hope it's useful
for you.
