For the end of master, I’m doing my internship at [French Development Agency]
[French Development Agency] as a data analyst in Guarantee Division (GAR), which
offers guarantees to banks providing loans to SMEs, thus limiting their risks.

In order to record the business operation of GAR, we have several databases.
Thus, during this internship, my principal mission is according to the business
procedure of GAR, merge all datasources into one with the process ETL (Extraction
-Transfer-Load), then analyse data to get the valuable information, which
contributes to our business.

Since I will finish it in two weeks, here I will share you its most important
and interesting part – data analysis with machine learning algorithm. In
consideration of the business of our division, the most important thing is not
only establishing business relation with more and more banks, but also limiting
the amount of compensation. Thus, I analysed the influence of different elements
on total amount of compensation in R, with Linear Regression Model and Decision
Tree.

## Linear Regression Model

### Model

As I mentioned above, the aim of analysis is to state the relationship between
each different elements and total amount of compensation. So the model is as
following.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="linear model" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-linearmodel.png"/>
</p>

The dependant variable represents the total amount of compensation in euro.
The explanatory variable  includes several control variables such as the loan
amount in euro, the guarantee amount in euro, and dummy variables of countries,
guarantee types, primary beneficiaries (our clients, i.e. banks), final
beneficiaries (banks’ clients, i.e. loanees). Among the omitted factors
represented by the error term, income of final beneficiaries may directly affect
the loan amount.

### Data

Since we focused on the total amount of compensation, the dataset “guarantee
activation” has been used for analysing. In this dataset, we have 296 observations
of 79 variables, I used 11 most important variables of them: total amount of
compensation in euro, N° concours, guarantee type, country, primary beneficiary,
N° primary beneficiary, final beneficiary, N° final beneficiary, loan amount in
euro, guarantee amount in euro and exchange rate.

Moreover, 36 observations are excluded due to incomplete information and 94
observations are excluded because of zero compensation amount. Thus, the final
sample consists of 166 observations instead of 296 observations with missing
value. Besides, since the amount of compensation, the loan amount and the
guarantee amount are pretty large, I reduced them by one thousand, which wouldn’t
influence the result of analysis.

### Data visualisation

Before analysing, let's make some graphs to better understand our data.

<img alt="DataVisualisation1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-dataviz1.png"/>

In this graph, x-axis stands for the amount of compensation (in thousand euro),
y-axis shows the name of country, legend indicates three guarantee types. So we
can clearly find that banks in Cameroon demand more compensation than others
which is mainly in the case of Portfolio Guarantee with the amount lower the 100
k€. Besides, for Single Deal Guarantee, the compensation amount is more various,
but most of them are lower than 300 k€. Moreover, the compensation of Comprehensive
Agreement is the least one, that might because this type of guarantee is no
longer commercialised.

<img alt="DataVisualisation2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-dataviz2.png"/>

According to this graph, we can get similar idea as the previous one.

<img alt="DataVisualisation3" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-dataviz3.png"/>

This graph shows that with the increasing of loan amount, the compensation
increases, which is the same as we expect.


### Result

I show the most important coefficients as following:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="EstmatedCoefficient" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-estimatedcoeff.png"/>
</p>

As Table 1 shows, according to the p-values which are under the significant
level, I got the variables that have significant effects on the total amount of
compensation. The country _Maurice_, the primary beneficiary _BOA Benin_, _Bank
of Mascarene_ and _MCB Ltd_ have significant effects on total amount of compensation
at **1%**. At **5%** level, the primary beneficiary _ALIOS_ has a significant
impact on total amount of compensation and at **10%** level, the beneficiary
_Credit of Senegal_ and the _loan amount_ also have a significant impact on it.

Some of the variables above have positive effects on the amount of compensation.
Ceteris paribus, signing one contract with _BOA Benin_ increases **179.6 thousand**
euros of total compensation. Signing one contract with _Bank of Mascarene_ leads
to **679.9 thousand** more euros, ceteris paribus. Thanks to the estimation
analysis, one contract with _MCB Ltd_ increases total compensation by **609
thousand** euros. Besides, there are other two variables whose effects are not
that outstanding. Ceteris paribus, one contract with _Credit of Senegal_ results
in **37.87 thousand** euros’ compensation. In addition, a €1000-increasing in
the _loan amount_ augments compensation amount by **17.05%**.

Moreover, we can observe that the model fits well the data since the value of R2
is **89.82%**, which is pretty high. However, the p-value and R2 are not enough.
In order to check whether this linear model is really confidential, I firstly
checked if the observations are independent with following codes and got the
graph below:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="fittedvalue vs. residuals" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-fittedvalue-residuals.png"/>

</p> 

{% highlight r %}
plot(lm_mej$fitted.values, lm_mej$residuals
{% endhighlight %}

According to this graph, we can observe that there is no correlation between
fitted values and residual, which means the observations are independent. Then,
I checked if all errors are normally distributed with the same variance and mean
equals to 0.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Normal Q-Q Plot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-normalqqplot.png"/>
</p>

{% highlight r %}
qqnorm(lm_mej$residuals)
{% endhighlight %}

This graph compares the quantiles of the residuals to the quantiles of the normal
distribution. It presents approximately a line, which indicated all errors are
normally distributed.

The statistical analysis by R tells us which bank has higher probability of
demanding the compensation, which means we should pay attention on it. For
instance, as the result of analysis, Bank of Mascarene has a significant effect
on total amount of compensation at 1%, so we may pay attention on this bank and
consider the rationality of our agreement with it.


## Decision Tree

In this part, the algorithm **CART(Classification And Regression Tree)** is used.
Firstly, the amount of compensation is divided into 3 groups(A, B and C),
according to the quantile. Then, all data are separated into _training set_ and
_test set_, with the ratio _3/1_. Next, in order to create a Decision Tree, we
need to use `library(rpart)` and `library(rpart.plot)`. Now, let's see some
details!

### Regression Tree

The Regression Tree can be created by the function `rpart()` with `method =
"anova"`, then use `rpart.plot()` to get the following graph.

<img alt="Regression Tree" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-DT-RT.png"/>

### Classification Tree

Similar as Regression Tree, Classification Tree is created by the function
`rpart()` but with `method = "class"`, and use `rpart.plot()` to get its graph.

<img alt="Classification Tree" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20161111-DT-CT.png"/>

Moreover, we can check the prediction with test set and find the error rate is
7.9%. Besides, according to the following confusion matrix, we can get accuracy
is 92%, which is pretty high.

{% highlight r %}
   predClass
     A  B  C
  A 28  1  0
  B  0  7  0
  C  0  2  0
{% endhighlight %}
