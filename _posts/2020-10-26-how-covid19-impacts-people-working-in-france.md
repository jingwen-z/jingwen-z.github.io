Faced with the scale of the health crisis linked to COVID-19, the French
Government has decided to structurally transform the partial activity mechanism,
to provide France with the most protective system in Europe.

Partial activity is a tool in the service of public policy for the prevention of
redundancies that allows employers in difficulty to have all or part of the cost
of the remuneration of their employees covered.

The partial activity is aimed at all employees who suffer a drop in remuneration
due to:
- either to a reduction in the working hours practiced in the establishment or
part of the establishment below the legal working hours;
- or to a temporary closure of all or part of the establishment.

During the period of partial activity:
- The employer receives from the Service and Payment Agency (ASP) an allowance
equivalent to a share of the hourly remuneration of the employee placed in
partial activity;
- The employee receives a partial activity allowance from his employer, instead
of his salary for the period during which he is placed in the partial activity.

## By section

The most impacted sections are commerce, administration services, construction,
and accommodation & restaurant. These sections need lots of contacts among
people, so they have to suspend their working; especially commerce, nearly 1.1
billion hours and around 300 thousand commercial organizations are impacted.

On the other hand, among all impacted sections some are not that impacted by
COVID, such as coking & refining, agriculture, forestry & fishing, machine
manufacturing, and extractive industries. Working in these sections does not
need to contact various people, so they are not that impacted.

## By region

Among all French regions, Ile-de-France is the most impacted one, that might
because of the reduction of tourists since the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted
lots of on restaurants, hotels, and other tourism-related business; moreover, the
commercial business is much more in Ile-de-France than in other regions, so that
more people are impacted. Similar reasons for Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.
