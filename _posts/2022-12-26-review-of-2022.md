## Introduction
During the year 2022, our life is almost back to normal, we started to take off
the mask, and have more contact with colleagues and friends.
As in previous years, it's time to review the whole year 2022. This year, I not
only levelled up my skills in technique but also in project management and
communication with clients.
In this blog, I'll resume my year 2022 with the following points:
- Working in retailing (In The Memory)
- Blogs

## Working in retailing (In The Memory)
[In The Memory][Memory] is a retail-tech company that helps retail players to
make the best use of the different internal and external data sources to meet
their strategic and operational business challenges. Our products allow
distributors and brands to accelerate their decision-making to attract more
customers and make the best assortment, merchandising, pricing, and promotional
choices, in their various physical and online sales channels. We build tailored
Augmented Intelligence solutions to meet clients' priority challenges and serve
their strategies by supporting their teams in change management, defining
together the best KPIs to meet clients' challenges and adapting our solutions to
the client's needs, constraints and processes. Moreover, this year, we have been
labelled happyatwork 2022 (this label rewards company in which employees are the
most committed and motivated), won the LSARetailTech trophy in the "Data,
knowledge and customer personalization" category, and have been selected by
Business France to represent France during the next Retail's Big Show in New
York in January 2023; we have nearly 70 colleagues vs. 50 in 2021.

This year, I'm promoted to Senior Data Scientist and levelled up my skills not
only in technique but also in project management and communication with clients.

### Head of Data Management projects for some clients
This year, I started to be in charge of data management for some clients. Thanks
to this project, I improve my skills in multiple aspects: maintaining the data
integration process, troubleshooting, designing the workflow for new data
integration, designing the retro planning with team consulting, interaction
among clients, team consulting and team data. All of these allow our clients to
well integrate their data into our system which is the base of our data products,
it also allows In The Memory to explore and create more products on the platform.

### Launch of 2 promotional data products
After more than 1-year development, we finally release these 2 promotional
modules for our client. Thanks to this project, I enrich my knowledge on
promotion business, know how to manage a project from the viewpoint of data, and
discuss the project with different teams (consulting and software). This product
helps users to save lots of time in defining the promotion leaflets and it can
also attract other retailers to use these amazing modules.

### Data reliability
We created some tools for ensuring data reliability. For example, we created the
first API of team data, this API allows us to check data format and quality
after the user imports the input files which ensures the data is ready to be
used to run our calculation and model. I also set up a staging environment for
the data team, which is isolated from the production environment, this allows us
to modify or develop new features without worrying about breaking the data in
production, this is a product guarantee and it's a playground!

### Recruiting talents for In The Memory
It has been 6 years since the graduation ceremony, this year I came back to
Toulouse School of Economics again to help In The Memory recruit talents. It was
an enriching experience for us to interact with students and teachers throughout
the day.

## Blogs

analysis, data visualisation, machine learning, and data science in retailing,
had more than 212k users come more than 301k times on my blogs.
