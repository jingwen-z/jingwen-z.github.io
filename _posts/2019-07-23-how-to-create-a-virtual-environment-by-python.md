Imagine that you are creating a project with python, and you need to import a
package which is not the same version as other project, what should we in this
situation? Maybe creating a virtual environment for this project is a good
choice. In this blog, I'll talk about virtual environment with the following
points:
- Why we create a virtual environment?
- How to create a virtual environment by Python?
- How to use virtual environment in Jupyter Notebook?


## Why we create a virtual environment?
In case of what I mentioned at the beginning, the virtual environment allows
you to use a certain version of a module for one project and another version
for another project: if you install the module system-wide and donâ€™t use venv,
then you can only use one version of the module.

In a word, virtual environment is able to ensure your modules' version for a
python project.

## How to create a virtual environment by Python?
Before creating a virtual environment by Python, you should make sure that you
have installed `pip`. For creating the virtual environment, we firstly install
`virtualenv` module:

{% highlight python %}
pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can create a virtual environment in the corresponding directory by
typing:

{% highlight python %}
python -m venv _venvname
{% endhighlight %}

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Creating a virtual environment"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190723-venv-1.PNG"/>
</p>

`_venvname` can be replaced by the name you want for your venv. In my example,
the name of venv is "_restauration_venv".

After creating your venv, you can activate it with:

{% highlight python %}
.\_venvname\Scripts\activate.bat
{% endhighlight %}

and install the modules you need:

{% highlight python %}
pip install -r requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Activate the virtual environment"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190723-venv-2.PNG"/>
</p>

Before leaving, you need to deactivate the venv:

{% highlight python %}
.\_venvname\Scripts\deactivate.bat
{% endhighlight %}

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Deactivate the virtual environment"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190723-venv-6.PNG"/>
</p>

## How to use virtual environment in Jupyter Notebook?
If you want to use virtual environment in Jupyter Notebook, you need to add a
kernel with it. First, activate your virtual environment; then install
`ipykernel`:

{% highlight python %}
pip install --user ipykernel
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can add your venv to Jupyter Notebook:

{% highlight python %}
ipython kernel install --user --name=_venvname 
{% endhighlight %}

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Create a kernel"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190723-venv-3.PNG"/>
</p>

Next, you can choose your kernel as following:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Choose the kernel"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190723-venv-4.PNG"/>
</p>

As soon as you choose, the kernel will update at the right top corner:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Kernel updated"
  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/20190723-venv-5.PNG"/>
</p>

## Conclusion
In this blog, I talked about why we create a virtual environment, how to create
a virtual environment by Python and how to use virtual environment in Jupyter
Notebook. Hope it's useful for you.
