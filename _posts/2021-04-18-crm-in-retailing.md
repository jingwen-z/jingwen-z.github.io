In retailing domain, one of the most important things is increasing the customer
satifaction and the customer loyalty. To reach the goals, we need to understand
CRM (Customer Relationship Management) firstly, then we can take steps to
improve them. In this blog, I'll talk about this with the following points:
- What is CRM ?
- How does CRM help retailers ?
- Applications in retailing
- CRM application in other industries

## What is CRM ?
Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to the principles, practices, and
guidelines that an organization follows when interacting with its customers.
From the organization's point of view, this entire relationship encompasses
direct interactions with customers, such as sales and service-related processes,
forecasting, and the analysis of customer trends and behaviors. Ultimately, CRM
serves to enhance the customer's overall experience. 

## How does CRM help retailers ?
[SAP INSIGHTS][r1] shows us five biggest benefits of CRM:
- **Improved customer experience:** Give contact center reps and field service
technicians a 360° view of customers – so they can deliver personalized customer
experiences and resolve issues quickly.  
- **Increased customer retention:** Wow your customers with personalized service
that wins loyalty. Run real-time analytics to identify the best offers, the
right timing, and the optimal channel.
- **Higher sales revenue:** Boost pipeline visibility and sell more – with
integrated tools for sales force automation, lead management, forecasting,
cross-selling, e-commerce, and more.  
- **Greater process efficiency:** Help your sales, marketing, and service teams
accomplish more with less effort – by taking advantage of automated processes
and scheduled follow-up prompts.
- **Work smarter – better collaboration:** Share information across teams,
departments, and internal and external stakeholders with collaborative CRM – to
better serve customers at every touchpoint. 

## Applications in retailing
Khalifa, Mohamed, and Ning Shen [1] developped, operationalized and empirically
tested a temporal model explaining the relationship between three categories
of eCRM (i.e., pre-purchase, at-purchase and post-purchase eCRM) and online
customer satisfaction at two phases of the customer lifecycle, i.e., attraction
and retention.

They used the customer lifecycle framework to conceptualize satisfaction and
relied on the transaction cycle to classify eCRM features. Their research model
identifies the important features for three types of eCRM, i.e., pre-purchase,
at-purchase, and post-purchase eCRM:
- Pre-purchase eCRM features
  * Site customization
  * Customer education
  * Alternative channels
  * Loyalty program membership
  * Search capabilities
  * Alerts
- At-purchase eCRM features
  * Product customization
  * Payment methods
  * Purchase conditions
  * Comparative shopping
  * Dynamic pricing
- Post-purchase eCRM features
  * Online sale of spare parts
  * Problem solving
  * Feedback channels
  * Order tracking
  * Online community
  * Web center

Their research found that the significance and magnitude of the effects of
product customization, website customization and dynamic pricing reflect the
perceived importance of eCRM activities that are intended to support the
one-to-one paradigm shift: transforming the relationship between the firm and
the customer from a one-to-many mode into a one-to-one mode. Other eCRM drivers
of customer satisfaction include alerts, search capabilities, order tracking and
problem solving. They represent another transformation of the relationship
between the firm and the customer: from passive to active. Another significant
variable, i.e., online community, is intended for yet another paradigm shift:
many-to-many marketing, where the customers are involved in providing value to
each other. 

Moreover, Khalid Rababah, Haslina Mohd, and Huda Ibrahim [3] suggested an
important step before the implementation of CRM programs/systems, which is the
creation and communication of customer-oriented culture within the
organizational. The purpose of this step is to be as a pre-implementation plan
for CRM programs/systems in which, a better understanding of the concept of CRM
and the sense and awareness of the CRM program/system are created within the
organization.

## CRM application in other industries
Except the application of CRM in retailing, CRM is also important in many other
industries:
- Banking: Due to the tough competition in the banking industry in Jordan, it is
very necessary for financial institutions to build and maintain a strong
relationship with the customers in order to achieve the ultimate goal of
customer satisfaction. The statistical analysis of Azzam, K [4] revealed that
there is a significant relationship between the independent variables(i.e., CRM
elements represented by service quality, employee’s behavior, customer data
base, solving customer problems physical environment; and social network
interaction) and customer satisfaction as a dependent variable in the services
banking industry.
- Education: The study of Olaleke, Oluseye Olaleke, Tairat Taiye Taiye, and
Emmanuel Olumide Olumide [5] explored the ways in which student satisfaction can
be achieved with the use of customer relationship management. Their research
findings showed that student's willingness to recommend to others increases when
the student lifecycle in the university is well managed. It was also discovered
that strong parent relationship management at the University enhances the
student's  willingness to recommend their Universities to others. It is
therefore recommended that Universities should adopt effective customer
relationship management strategies to achieve student satisfaction.
- Mobile telecom: With the expansive growth of mobile commerce come
opportunities for business and mobile service providers. To distinguish its
service from another's and build a loyal customer base, a mobile service
provider must look beyond technology and appeal to their customers'
individuality through CRM. A study of Chen, Ja-Shen, and Russell KH Ching [6]
examined the relationships of CRM practices and mobile services with customer
loyalty, and the moderating effects of brand image was conducted. The results
suggest that all contribute to loyalty. However, brand image moderates the
relationships of customer service and customization, and mobile usage with
customer loyalty.

## Conclusion
This blog talked about what is CRM and its 5 biggest benefits, it also presented
the application in retailing and other industies, such as banking, education and
mobile telecom. Hope it's useful for you!
