More than four years as a data scientist in retailing. In my blog, I usually
share what I learnt during work or personal projects, data analysis or
visualisation with open source data around the following topics:
- Python
- SQL
- API application
- Data analysis
- Visualisation
- Machine Learning

My blog is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll], a simple, static, blog-aware site
generator. It is also powered by [TeXt Theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme),
a super customizable Jekyll theme written by Tian Qi ([kitian616](https://github.com/kitian616)).
