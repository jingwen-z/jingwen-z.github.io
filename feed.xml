&lt;p&gt;People who are familiar with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openpyxl&lt;/code&gt; know that we can use it to read/write
Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files. As I presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://jingwen-z.github.io/how-to-munipulate-excel-workbook-by-python/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;,
we can create a workbook, assign values to some cells, apply number formats,
merge cells, etc. However, if we need to create an Excel dashboard as the
following, should we accomplish all formats with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openpyxl&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211127-portfolio-dashboard&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211127-portfolio-dashboard.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the question above, we can resolve it from another point of view: we can
create an Excel template with the fixed format, such as dashboard title and logo,
subtitles, then write values into this template. In this blog, I’ll show you how
to do this with the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Context&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write data into the template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an Excel template named “template.xlsx”, which contains two worksheets
“category” and “product”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211127-category-template&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211127-category-template.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worksheet “category” shows the performance of each category with different
indicators like turnover, volume, number of clients, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211127-product-template&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211127-product-template.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worksheet “product” shows the performance of each product with the same
indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what we need to insert into these two worksheets are three pandas dataframes:
classic_indicators_df, other_indicators_df and products_detail_df.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211127-category-df&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211127-category-df.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211127-product-df&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211127-product-df.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;write-data-into-the-template&quot;&gt;Write data into the template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all data preparation, the next target is writing the three dataframes into
the template with several steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the workbook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a writer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write dataframe into the template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;load-the-workbook&quot;&gt;Load the workbook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;openpyxl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load_workbook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'./template.xlsx'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We load the template with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openpyxl.load_workbook&lt;/code&gt; by indicating the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-writer&quot;&gt;Create a writer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'./final_report.xlsx'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;writer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ExcelWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;writer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set the writer with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pandas.ExcelWriter&lt;/code&gt; that allows to write DataFrame
objects into excel sheets, and set the template file as the writer’s workbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;write-dataframe-into-the-template&quot;&gt;Write dataframe into the template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles.borders import Border, Side
import string

def set_border(ws, cell_range):
    rows = ws[cell_range]
    side = Side(border_style='thin', color=&quot;FF000000&quot;)

    rows = list(rows)
    max_y = len(rows) - 1  # index of the last row
    for pos_y, cells in enumerate(rows):
        max_x = len(cells) - 1  # index of the last cell
        for pos_x, cell in enumerate(cells):
            border = Border(
                left=cell.border.left,
                right=cell.border.right,
                top=cell.border.top,
                bottom=cell.border.bottom
            )
            border.left = side
            border.right = side
            border.top = side
            border.bottom = side
            
            cell.border = border
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before writing into the template, I create a function &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;set_border()&lt;/code&gt; by using
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Side()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Border()&lt;/code&gt; to set borders for each cell in the given range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df_sheet_list = [(classic_indicators_df, 'category'),
                 (other_indicators_df, 'category'),
                 (products_detail_df, 'product')]

for (df, sht) in df_sheet_list:
    templ_sht = template[sht]
    writer.sheets = {templ_sht.title:templ_sht}

    if df is classic_indicators_df:
        classic_indicators_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=sht, index=False,
                                       header=False, startrow=13, startcol=2)
        set_border(writer.sheets[sht], f&quot;C14:G{14-1+len(df)}&quot;)
    elif df is other_indicators_df:
        other_indicators_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=sht, index=False,
                                       header=False, startrow=13, startcol=8)
        set_border(writer.sheets[sht], f&quot;I14:M{14-1+len(df)}&quot;)
    elif df is products_detail_df:
        products_detail_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=sht, index=False,
                                       header=False, startrow=12, startcol=4)
        set_border(writer.sheets[sht], f&quot;E13:K{13-1+len(df)}&quot;)

writer.save()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assign the sheet where we will insert the dateframe to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;writer.sheets&lt;/code&gt;.
Then we write the dataframe with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.to_excel&lt;/code&gt; by specifying the writer we use,
the worksheet that we want to insert, and the start row and the start column
with integers, after all these steps, we save the file with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;writer.save()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with the COVID-19 virus, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. In order to achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped. And a vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort of scientists. Last time, I analyzed the adverse reactions of Pfizer vaccine, Coronavac vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine and Modena vaccine. Today we will compare the side effects of different vaccines in a longitudinal direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting, introduce the following two terms that will be frequently mentioned next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local reaction: A reaction that occurs at the entrance of an infected organism or injection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Systemic reaction: When inflammation spreads from a local area of ​​an organ (such as the skin) to other organ systems in the body, it is called a systemic reaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-background&quot;&gt;Data background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;coronavac-vaccine&quot;&gt;Coronavac vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instituto Butantan (Instituto Butantan) announced the final results of the Phase III clinical trial of the COVID-19 vaccine of China Kexing Company in Brazil. From July 21 to December 16, 2020, 12842 participants were screened at 16 research sites in Brazil, and 12408 participants were randomly grouped. A total of 12396 participants received at least one dose of Coronavac vaccine or placebo, including 6195 in the vaccine group and 6201 in the placebo group. Among the 12396 participants, 5.1% were elderly participants 60 years or older, 64.2% were women, and most of the participants claimed to be white (75.3%). More than half of the participants (55.9%) had underlying diseases, of which 22.5% were obese (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2). The average age and BMI of the participants were 39.5 years and 26.8 kg/m2, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modena-vaccine&quot;&gt;Modena vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released data on the response and severity of people of different ages after being vaccinated with Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine. As of November 11, 2020, 30350 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio, with a median follow-up period of 7 weeks after the second vaccination. 75.2% of the participants in the vaccine group were between 18 and 65 years old, 47.8% were women; 79% were white, 10% were black or African American, and 4.3% were Asian participants. The median age is 53 years. 27% of the participants had underlying diseases, and 5% had major heart diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pfizer-biontech-vaccine&quot;&gt;Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released data on the response and severity of populations of different ages after being vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data for people over 18 years old: As of November 14, 2020, 43252 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio, and the median follow-up time was 2 months after the second vaccination. They included 49.4% of women, 81.9% of whites, 9.8% of African Americans, 4.4% of Asian participants and &amp;lt;3% of other ethnic groups; 26.2% of participants were Hispanic/Latino; 21.4% Participants are &amp;gt;65 years old. The median age is 51 years. The most frequently reported comorbidities were obesity (35.1%), diabetes (with or without chronic complications, 8.4%) and lung disease (7.8%). Geographically, 76.7% of the participants are from the United States, 15.3% are from Argentina, 6.1% are from Brazil, and 2% are from South Africa.
Data on people aged 12-15: On April 9, 2021, Pfizer-Biotech supplemented the test results of people aged 12-15 and stated that the vaccine can be used in this group. 2260 adolescents aged 12-15 were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a ratio of 1:1, with a median follow-up period of 2 months after the second vaccination. They included 49.3% of women, 88.0% of whites, 7.7% of African Americans, 2.4% of Asians, and &amp;lt;2% of other ethnic groups; 10.5% of participants were Hispanic/Latino. The median age is 14 years. 21.5% of participants had one or more comorbidities that would increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Geographically, all participants live in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;astrazeneca-vaccine&quot;&gt;AstraZeneca vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data released by the AstraZeneca vaccine trial group at the University of Oxford. From May 30 to August 8, 2020, 560 participants were included in the study and randomly assigned to the experimental vaccine group or the control vaccine group: 160 participants between the ages of 18-55 (100 assigned To ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 were assigned to MenACWY), 160 were 56-69 years old (120 were assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 40 were assigned to MenACWY) and 240 were 70 years and older (200 were assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19, 40 were assigned to MenACWY).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-most-obvious-reaction-after-the-injection-of-modena&quot;&gt;The most obvious reaction after the injection of Modena&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211030-global-comparaison&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211030-global-comparaison.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it is a local reaction or a systemic reaction, the reaction is most obvious after the injection of Modena. 86% of people have local reactions, such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site, and nearly 67% have a systemic reaction. Such as fatigue, chills, joint pain, muscle pain, etc. Followed by the Kexing vaccine, 62% of people had a local reaction after injection, and 58% had a systemic reaction. Among the four vaccines, the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine caused the least adverse reactions. The probability of local and systemic reactions after vaccination was 29.5% and 22.4%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-4-vaccines-are-easy-to-cause-pain-and-chills-at-the-injection-site&quot;&gt;All 4 vaccines are easy to cause pain and chills at the injection site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211030-local-reactions-comparaison&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211030-local-reactions-comparaison.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the four vaccines, pain at the injection site is the most prone to local reaction, especially after the injection of Modena or Pfizer-Biotech vaccine, the probability of this reaction is as high as 70%-85%. The possibility of swelling and redness is much lower, and none of the 4 vaccines is higher than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-1&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fatigue, chills and joint pain, the probability of the above three systemic reactions after the first injection of AstraZeneca vaccine is higher than the other three vaccines (fatigue: 56%, chills: 17%, joint pain: 22%), but the probability of adverse reactions after the second shot of Modena vaccine is the highest among the four vaccines (fatigue: 65%, chills: 44%, arthralgia: 43%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-2&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data released by the AstraZeneca vaccine trial group at the University of Oxford did not mention the adverse reaction of headache, but the probability of headache caused by the other three COVID-19 vaccines is still higher, especially the second dose of Modena or Pfizer- After the biotech vaccine, there is a 50% chance of headache. However, 10%-20% of people feel nausea/vomiting after being vaccinated with AstraZeneca. There is a similar situation with Modena vaccine. On the contrary, people who have received Pfizer-Biotech vaccine are less than 2% likely to have the same Reaction. Instituto Butantan, Brazil’s Instituto Butantan, announced that the Coronavac COVID-19 vaccine in the final study results of Brazil’s Phase III clinical trial did not mention the fever response. After the second shot of the other three vaccines, 10% There is a -15% probability of having a fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-3&quot; src=&quot;/images/20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the data released by the AstraZeneca vaccine trial group at the University of Oxford did not mention the adverse reactions of muscle pain and diarrhea. The data on the reaction and severity of the COVID-19 vaccine also did not mention the reaction of diarrhea. However, after vaccination with Modena and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, more than 20% of people will feel muscle pain, especially after the second dose of Modena, the proportion is close to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination&quot;&gt;What should I pay attention to after vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods, seafood foods, and drinking alcohol. It is recommended to drink plenty of water (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to avoid strenuous exercise and keep adequate rest (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures should be taken to protect yourself and others during travel (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should still pay attention to the symptoms of COVID-19, especially when you are with patients. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should be tested and self-isolate, away from others (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, in clinical trials, at least 40% of people will feel pain at the injection site regardless of the first or second injection, and at least 30% may feel tired or headache, especially if they have been vaccinated with Modena or Pfizer. -After the biotech vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After vaccination, you should pay attention to the light diet and keep adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with the COVID-19 virus, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. In order to achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped. And a vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort of scientists. Last time, I analyzed the adverse reactions of Pfizer vaccine, Coronavac vaccine and AstraZeneca vaccine, and my friends wanted to know the side effects of Modena vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released data on the response and severity of people of different ages after being vaccinated with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Today, I will take you to learn more about the specific information. Before starting, introduce the following two terms that will be frequently mentioned next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local reaction: A reaction that occurs at the entrance of an infected organism or injection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Systemic reaction: When inflammation spreads from a local area of ​​an organ (such as the skin) to other organ systems in the body, it is called a systemic reaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-background&quot;&gt;Data background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210920-ethnic&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210920-ethnic.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210920-underlying-disease&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210920-underlying-disease.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of November 11, 2020, 30,350 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio, with a median follow-up period of 7 weeks after the second vaccination. 75.2% of the participants in the vaccine group were between 18 and 65 years old, 47.8% were women; 79% were white, 10% were black or African American, and 4.3% were Asian participants. The median age is 53 years. 27% of the participants had underlying diseases, and 5% had major heart diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pain-at-the-injection-site-is-most-common&quot;&gt;Pain at the injection site is most common&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210920-local-reactions&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210920-local-reactions.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the local reactions, pain at the injection site is a common adverse reaction of all ages, and it is most obvious after the second injection, especially for people aged 18-64 years old, the probability of occurrence is as high as 90%; compared to the pain at the injection site, redness The odds are much lower, less than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210920-sys-reactions&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210920-sys-reactions.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the systemic reactions, the overall probability of adverse reactions after the second injection is higher than that of the first injection, or even doubled. The more common ones are fatigue, headache and muscle pain; it is worth noting that the same adverse reactions As age increases, the probability of occurrence decreases. For example, among 18-64-year-olds, 68% of people will feel fatigued after the second injection, but for people 65 and older, this ratio drops to 58 %.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;different-people-have-different-levels-of-sensitivity&quot;&gt;Different people have different levels of sensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210920-local-reactions-detail&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210920-local-reactions-detail.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 80% of people will experience mild or moderate pain at the injection site, and 10%-15% will experience mild or moderate axillary swelling/tenderness.
In addition, 4%-6% of people have slight or moderate swelling at the injection site after the first injection, and this proportion rises to 10%-12% after the second injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210920-sys-reactions-details-1&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210920-sys-reactions-details-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30%-40% of people will feel mild or moderate fatigue after the first injection. After the second injection, this proportion rises to 50%-60%, and there is a 10% probability of severe fatigue. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar situation, there is the symptom of headache. The difference is that the probability of severe headache is 3%-5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, about 5%-10% of people will feel mild or moderate chills after the first injection. The proportion of people aged 18-64 after the second injection rises to 48%. For 65-year-olds About 30% of people and above feel mild or moderate chills after the second shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210920-sys-reactions-details-2&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210920-sys-reactions-details-2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 20% of people will feel mild or moderate muscle pain after the first injection. After the second injection, this proportion rises to 40%-50%, and there is a 5%-10% probability that it will be severe. Fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probability of joint pain is slightly lower than that of muscle pain. The probability of mild or moderate joint pain after the first shot is less than 20%, but after the second shot, the probability increases greatly, especially for people aged 18-64. One proportion doubles to 40%; and there is a 3%-6% probability that there will be severe joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with the above adverse reactions, the probability of nausea or vomiting is not so high. After the first injection, there is a 5%-10% probability of feeling mild or moderate nausea or vomiting. This probability rises to 10%-20% after the second injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination&quot;&gt;What should I pay attention to after vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods, seafood foods, and drinking alcohol. It is recommended to drink plenty of water (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to avoid strenuous exercise and keep adequate rest (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures should be taken to protect yourself and others during travel (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should still pay attention to the symptoms of COVID-19, especially when you are with patients. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should be tested and self-isolate, away from others (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, in clinical trials, regardless of the first or second needle, there is about 80% probability that the injection site will feel pain, and there is a 35%-60% probability that you will feel fatigue or headache. After the second injection, the feeling will be more obvious than the first injection, but most of them are mild or moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After vaccination, you should pay attention to the light diet and keep adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.&lt;/p&gt;

And a vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort of scientists. Last time, I analyzed the adverse reactions of Pfizer vaccine and Coronavac vaccine, and my friends wanted to know the side effects of AstraZeneca vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I will borrow the data released by the AstraZeneca Vaccine Trial Group at the University of Oxford to show you the specific information. Before starting, introduce the following two terms that will be frequently mentioned next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local reaction: A reaction that occurs at the entrance of an infected organism or injection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Systemic reaction: When inflammation spreads from a local area of ​​an organ (such as the skin) to other organ systems in the body, it is called a systemic reaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-background&quot;&gt;Data background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From May 30 to August 8, 2020, 560 participants were included in the study and randomly assigned to the experimental vaccine group or the control vaccine group: 160 participants between the ages of 18-55 (100 assigned To ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 were assigned to MenACWY), 160 were 56-69 years old (120 were assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 40 were assigned to MenACWY) and 240 were 70 years and older (200 were assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19, 40 were assigned to MenACWY).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18-55 years old population data: They include 47% of women, 82% of white people, 14% of Asian participants and 4% of other ethnic groups. The median age is 39 years. 92% were drinkers, 36% of participants had underlying diseases, and 20% had respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data for 56-69-year-olds: They include 53% of women, 87% of whites and 13% of Asian participants. The median age is 59.5 years. 97% were alcohol drinkers and 0 smokers. 23% of the participants had underlying diseases and 13% had cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data for people over 70 years old: 43% of them are women, and all participants are white. The median age is 73 years. 86% were drinkers and 0 smokers. 41% of the participants had underlying diseases and 27% had cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tenderness-and-fatigue-are-the-most-common&quot;&gt;Tenderness and fatigue are the most common&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the local reactions, tenderness and pain at the injection site are common adverse reactions of all ages, and they are most obvious after the first injection, especially for people aged 18-55 years old, the probability of occurrence is as high as 60%; compared to the pain at the injection site, The chance of itching and redness is much lower, less than 10%. In addition, people over the age of 70 have less than 5% of the possibility of swelling or induration after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210820-sys-reactions-70plus&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210820-sys-reactions-70plus.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the systemic reactions, the overall risk of adverse reactions after the first injection is higher than that after the second injection. The more common ones are fatigue, headache and muscle pain. It is worth noting that the same adverse reactions increase with age. The probability of occurrence will be reduced. For example, among 18-55-year-olds, 75% of people will feel tired after the first injection, but for 56-69-year-olds, this proportion drops to 50%, and for 70-year-olds For the above population, this proportion is reduced to 41%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;different-people-have-different-levels-of-sensitivity&quot;&gt;Different people have different levels of sensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210820-local-reactions-detail&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210820-local-reactions-detail.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half of the population will experience mild tenderness, and about 60% of the 18-55-year-old population will experience mild or moderate pain at the injection site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People aged 18-55 are the most sensitive to slight pain at the injection site. Especially at the first injection, more than 40% of them will feel slightly fatigued. This ratio is twice that of people over 70 years old. In addition, the injection site is suffering Almost all people suffering from pain are between 18-55 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For itching, although the probability of occurrence is much lower than the first two, there are still 10% of people aged 18-55 who will feel moderate itching after the second injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210820-sys-reactions-details-1&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210820-sys-reactions-details-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 30% of people will feel slight fatigue regardless of the first or second injection. Among them, 56-69-year-olds are most sensitive to slight fatigue after the second injection. In addition, more than 20% of people aged 18-55 will experience moderate fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For headaches, the most common degree is mild headaches, and people aged 56-69 are the most sensitive to this. The probability of occurrence after the first injection is as high as 50%, but after the second injection, this proportion is reduced to 30% .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People over 18 years of age have a 20% chance of experiencing mild muscle pain after vaccination. In the trial, no people over 56 years of age felt moderate or more severe muscle pain, but about 20% of people aged 18-55 would have Feel moderate muscle pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210820-sys-reactions-details-2&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210820-sys-reactions-details-2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first vaccination, 25% of the 18-55-year-old people will feel moderate discomfort, and those over 56 years old will have a 20% chance of feeling mild discomfort; after the second vaccination, the proportion of moderate discomfort will decrease. To about 5%, but there are still 20% of 18-55-year-old people feel mild discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fever, people aged 18-55 have a 40% chance of experiencing mild, moderate or severe fever. This proportion is greatly reduced to 10% after the second injection; in addition, people over 56 years old will also have 10% chance of feeling mild fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among people aged 18-55, the probability of joint pain is about 30%, especially after the first vaccination; for people over 56 years old, there is a 17% chance of feeling mild joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210820-sys-reactions-details-3&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210820-sys-reactions-details-3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among 18-55-year-olds, the probability of getting chills after the first shot is about 40%, and this rate is reduced to 14% after the second shot; people over 56 years old are not very sensitive to chills, only 10% Possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first shot, about 27% of people aged 18-55 will feel nauseous, and after the second shot, this proportion drops to 8%; people aged 56-69 have a 13% chance of feeling slightly nauseous, on the contrary However, this proportion increased to 21% after the second shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-astrazenecas-adverse-reactions-really-big&quot;&gt;Are AstraZeneca’s adverse reactions really big?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King’s College London, Harvard Medical School and other units published an article on adverse reactions after injection of the COVID-19 vaccine on Lancet Infect Dis on April 21, 2021, which compared the different adverse effects after vaccination with Pfizer and AstraZeneca reaction. Let’s compare them below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210820-local-reactions-pfizerVSaz&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210820-local-reactions-pfizerVSaz.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of local reactions, the first shot of AstraZeneca was not as severe as the first shot of Pfizer vaccine, especially the second shot of Pfizer. For some local reactions, the second injection of Pfizer is much more likely to occur than AstraZeneca, such as pain at the injection site (34.26% vs. 19.1%), swelling (9.75% vs. 5.5%), redness (7.23%) vs. 4.18%) etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210820-sys-reactions-pfizerVSaz&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210820-sys-reactions-pfizerVSaz.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we look at the systemic reaction, the reaction to the first shot of AstraZeneca is more severe than the second shot of Pfizer, even if compared with the second shot of Pfizer: the probability of fatigue and headache is higher than that of the second shot of Pfizer by 7%-10 %, the chance of chills and shaking is more than double that of Pfizer (6.42% vs. 14.70%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vaccination-with-astrazeneca--thrombosis&quot;&gt;Vaccination with AstraZeneca = Thrombosis?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2021, two Austrian women suffered from coagulation disorders after being vaccinated with the vaccine. One of them died and the other was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism. Although the connection between blood clots and vaccination was not yet established, people have naturally regarded blood clots as one of the side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine. But is this really the case? How high is the chance of thrombosis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news/item/16-04-2021-global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety-(gacvs)-review-of-latest-evidence-of-rare-adverse-blood-coagulation-events-with-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-(vaxzevria-and-covishield)&quot;&gt;Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) review of latest evidence of rare adverse blood coagulation events with AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine (Vaxzevria and Covishield)&lt;/a&gt;”published by the World Health Organization , it was mentioned that according to the latest available data, the AstraZeneca vaccine caused The risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome appears to be very low. Data from the United Kingdom shows that there are about 4 cases per million adults (1 case per 250,000 people) vaccinated, while the EU estimates the ratio is about 1 case per 100,000 people. Luo Yijun, deputy head of the medical response team of the Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center, said in mid-March that the incidence of thrombosis in Europeans and Americans is 5 to 10 times that of the yellow race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some investigators have investigated the age distribution of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome. The Global Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee supports further research to understand age-related risks, because although existing data indicate that young people are at higher risk, further analysis is needed. Regarding the issue of gender-related risks, although more cases have been reported among women, it must be emphasized that more women are vaccinated, and some cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome have also been reported among men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four other categories of people, including those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation abnormalities, and women who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant, etc., should first assess the benefits and risks before deciding whether to vaccinate. (Source: BBC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination&quot;&gt;What should I pay attention to after vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods, seafood foods, and drinking alcohol. It is recommended to drink plenty of water (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to avoid strenuous exercise and keep adequate rest (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures should be taken to protect yourself and others during travel (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should still pay attention to the symptoms of COVID-19, especially when you are with patients. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should be tested and self-isolate, away from others (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, in clinical trials, regardless of the first or second needle, there is a 60% probability that the injection site will feel tenderness, and there is a 30%-50% probability that you will feel tired or headache. After the second injection, the feeling will not be as obvious as the first injection. In addition, considering that there are not many test samples, the credibility of the data needs to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After vaccination, you should pay attention to the lightness of your diet and maintain adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with COVID-19, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. To achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped. A vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort from scientists. Among Chinese vaccines, the most familiar one is Coronavac vaccine, but do you know its adverse reactions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instituto Butantan announced the final results of the Phase III clinical trial of China’s Coronavac COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil. Today, I will take you to learn more about the specific information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instituto-butantan&quot;&gt;Instituto Butantan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting the text, let’s get a general understanding of the Basilis Butantan Institute: It is the largest immunobiology and biopharmaceutical manufacturer in Latin America (and one of the largest in the world), and is considered to be the world’s main science One of the centers. It is world-famous for collecting venomous snakes as well as venomous lizards, spiders, insects and scorpions. By extracting the venom of reptiles and insects, the institute has developed antivenoms and drugs against many diseases, including tuberculosis, rabies, tetanus and diphtheria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;authorization&quot;&gt;Authorization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Peicheng, Director of Branding and Public Relations of Kexing, said that Kexing’s COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for use in nearly 30 countries and regions, including China, Chile, Brazil, and Turkey, including emergency use, conditional listing or official listing, and has been launched one after another. Large-scale vaccination work. As of April 21, 2021, a total of 160 million doses have been vaccinated globally, including China. The World Health Organization (WHO) approved the emergency use of Kexing COVID-19 vaccine on June 1, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-background&quot;&gt;Data background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210715-ethnic&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210715-ethnic.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210715-underlying-disease&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210715-underlying-disease.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From July 21 to December 16, 2020, 12842 participants were screened at 16 research sites in Brazil, and 12408 participants were randomly grouped. A total of 12396 participants received at least one dose of Coxing vaccine or placebo, including 6195 in the vaccine group and 6,201 in the placebo group. Among the 12396 participants, 5.1% were elderly participants 60 years or older, 64.2% were women, and most of the participants claimed to be white (75.3%). More than half of the participants (55.9%) had underlying diseases, of which 22.5% were obese (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2). The average age and BMI of the participants were 39.5 years and 26.8 kg/m2, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;most-adverse-reactions-will-occur-within-7-days-of-vaccination&quot;&gt;Most adverse reactions will occur within 7 days of vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210715-global-1&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210715-global-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 75% of adverse reactions occur within one week after vaccination, but adverse reactions occur within one hour after vaccination, but the probability is relatively low, about 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210715-global-2&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210715-global-2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the trial population, half of them had adverse reactions with different symptoms and different degrees, and the probability of local reactions (62%) was slightly higher than that of systemic reactions (58%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local reaction: A reaction that occurs at the entrance of an infected organism or injection.
Systemic reaction: When inflammation spreads from a local area of ​​an organ (such as the skin) to other organ systems in the body, it is called a systemic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-adverse-reactions-of-the-second-vaccination-were-milder-than-the-first&quot;&gt;The adverse reactions of the second vaccination were milder than the first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210715-common-local&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210715-common-local.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from the common reactions after the two inoculations, among the local reactions, the reaction of the second inoculation will be slightly more obvious than the first but the difference is not much. The most common reaction is still pain at the injection site. The probability of this reaction in the second injection has increased by 1.83% compared with the first time. It is also the most likely increase in the probability of these five local reactions. In addition to the above-mentioned common adverse reactions, there are some reactions that will occur with a very small probability. For example, after the first dose of vaccination, there is a 0.1% probability of fever and a 0.06% probability of localized rash. After the second injection, the probability of hardening of the inoculation site, exfoliation of the epidermis, or pustules was less than 0.05%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210715-common-systemic&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210715-common-systemic.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from the common reaction after the two vaccination, in the systemic reaction, the reaction of the second vaccination was mostly weaker than that of the first vaccination. Especially for “headache”, “fatigue” and “nausea”, their chances of appearing decreased by 6.54%, 4.78% and 2% respectively. With regard to vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, skin rashes, blushing and other adverse reactions, the probability of occurrence is less than 1%. In addition to the above-mentioned common adverse reactions, there are some reactions that will occur with a very small probability. For example, after the first dose of vaccination, there is a 0.42% probability of back pain, 0.26% of oral herpes, 0.19% probability of hyperhidrosis, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, muscle weakness, heart palpitations, etc. less than 1% will occur reaction. After the second injection, there is a 0.46% chance of limb pain, a 0.33% chance of breathing difficulties, a 0.11% chance of edema, and tachycardia, anxiety, pharyngitis, and other reactions less than 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination&quot;&gt;What should I pay attention to after vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods, seafood foods, and drinking alcohol. It is recommended to drink plenty of water (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to avoid strenuous exercise and keep adequate rest (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures should still be taken to protect yourself and others during travel (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should still pay attention to the symptoms of COVID-19, especially when you are with patients. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should be tested and self-isolate, stay away from others (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, in clinical trials, regardless of the first or second needle, there is a 45% probability that the injection site will feel pain, and there is a 20%-30% probability that you will feel tired or headache. After the second injection, the feeling will not be as obvious as the first injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After vaccination, you should pay attention to the light diet and keep adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with COVID-19, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. To achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped. A vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort from scientists. Among so many vaccines, the most familiar one is the Pfizer vaccine, but do you know its adverse reactions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released data on the response and degree of the population of different ages after being vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech. Today, I will take you to learn more about the specific information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-background&quot;&gt;Data background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published experimental data for people of different age groups: one group was an adult group (more than 18 years old), and the other group was a teenager group (12-15 years old).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data for people over 18 years old: As of November 14, 2020, 43,252 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio, and the median follow-up time was 2 months after the second vaccination. They included 49.4% of women, 81.9% of whites, 9.8% of African Americans, 4.4% of Asian participants and &amp;lt;3% of other ethnic groups; 26.2% of participants were Hispanic/Latino; 21.4% Participants are &amp;gt;65 years old. The median age is 51 years. The most frequently reported comorbidities were obesity (35.1%), diabetes (with or without chronic complications, 8.4%) and lung disease (7.8%). Geographically, 76.7% of the participants are from the United States, 15.3% are from Argentina, 6.1% are from Brazil, and 2% are from South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data on people aged 12-15: On April 9, 2021, Pfizer-Biotech supplemented the test results of people aged 12-15 and stated that the vaccine can be used in this group. 2260 adolescents aged 12-15 were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a ratio of 1:1, with a median follow-up period of 2 months after the second vaccination. They included 49.3% of women, 88.0% of whites, 7.7% of African Americans, 2.4% of Asians, and &amp;lt;2% of other ethnic groups; 10.5% of the participants were Hispanic/Latino. The median age is 14 years. 21.5% of participants had one or more comorbidities that would increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Geographically, all participants live in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pain-at-the-injection-site-is-most-common&quot;&gt;Pain at the injection site is most common&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210701-global-reactions1&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210701-global-reactions1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the local reactions, pain at the injection site is a common adverse reaction of all ages, and it is most obvious after the first injection, especially for people aged 12-55 years old, the probability of occurrence is as high as 80%; compared to the pain at the injection site, the probability of swelling and redness is much lower, which is less than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210701-global-reactions2&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210701-global-reactions2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the systemic reactions, the overall probability of adverse reactions after the second injection is higher than that of the first injection. The more common ones are fatigue, headache and muscle pain. It is worth noting that the probability of the same adverse reactions occurrence will be reduced with age increasing. For example, among people aged 12-15, 60% will feel fatigued after the first injection, but for people aged 18-55, this proportion drops to 47%, and for people aged &amp;gt; 55-year-olds, this proportion is reduced to 34%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;different-people-have-different-levels-of-sensitivity&quot;&gt;Different people have different levels of sensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210701-detail-reactions-1&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210701-detail-reactions-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, “Mild” means not affecting daily activities, “Moderate” means beginning to affect daily activities, “Severe” means hindering daily activities, and “Grade 4” means going to the emergency room or hospitalized due to severe pain at the injection site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of people over the age of 18 will experience mild pain at the injection site, and about 80% of people aged 12-15 will experience mild or moderate pain at the injection site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People aged 12-15 are most sensitive to mild fatigue, especially during the second injection, 40% of them will feel slightly fatigued, which is twice the proportion of people over 18 years old; but people over 18 years old feel moderate fatigue more easily than people aged 12-15, especially those aged 18-55, which have a 35% probability that they will feel moderately fatigued after the second injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For headaches, the most common degree is a moderate headache. Among people aged 12-15, 22.3% have a moderate headache after the first injection, but the proportion of people experiencing a moderate headache after the second injection has risen to 35%. A similar situation also appeared in people over the age of 18, 19.2% of people had a moderate headache after the first injection, but after the second injection, this proportion rose to 36%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210701-detail-reactions-2&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210701-detail-reactions-2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, “Mild” means not affecting daily activities, “Moderate” means beginning to affect daily activities, “Severe” means hindering daily activities, and “Grade 4” means going to the emergency room or hospitalized due to severe pain at the injection site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response of different age groups to different degrees of muscle pain is similar. About 5%-10% of people feel mild or moderate pain after the first injection. This proportion rises to 15%-20% after the second injection. People over the age of 18 who received the second shot of the vaccine are more sensitive to joint pain than those aged 12-15, and the probability of occurrence is doubled after the first shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with muscle pain and joint pain, people aged 12-15 are more likely to feel chills. About 30% of them feel mild or moderate chills after the first injection, this proportion increased to 40% after the second injection. The same reaction is 14% and 33% for people aged 18-55, and it is even lower for people over 55: 6% and 22%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination&quot;&gt;What should I pay attention to after vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods, seafood foods, and drinking alcohol. It is recommended to drink plenty of water (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to avoid strenuous exercise and keep adequate rest (source: Zhihu)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures should still be taken to protect yourself and others during travel (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should still pay attention to the symptoms of COVID-19, especially when you are with patients. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should be tested and self-isolate, stay away from others (Source: CDC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, in clinical trials, regardless of the first or the second dose, there is about 80% probability that the injection site will feel pain, and there is a 30%-50% probability that you will feel tired or headache. After the second injection, the feeling will be more obvious than the first injection, but it is mostly mild or moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After vaccination, you should pay attention to the light diet and keep adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we need to calculat some KPIs by running Azure Databricks notebook,
before the calculation we also need to check our input data to ensure that they
satisfy some rules, such as check if clients are in our database, check if there
is the overlap between the period of analysis and the period of comparison, or
count the sample of each input files (clients, stores, or products), etc.
Sometimes, the demand comes from other teams, like marketing or innovation
teams, to optimise the working process, creating a data pipeline and communicate
on slack should be helpful. Since in my working environment, we use Microsoft
Azure, in this blog, I’ll create a data pipeline with Azure Data Factory and
talk about the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is Microsoft Azure?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is Slack?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to create a date pipeline with Azure Data Factory and Databricks?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to communicate data pipeline’s result on Slack?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-microsoft-azure&quot;&gt;What is Microsoft Azure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Azure, commonly referred to as Azure, is a cloud computing service
created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications
and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a
service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service
(IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks,
including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.
Moreover, Azure Data Factory is a data integration service that allows creation
of data-driven workflows in the cloud for orchestrating and automating data
movement and data transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Databricks is an enterprise software company founded by the
original creators of Apache Spark. Databricks develops a web-based platform for
working with Spark, that provides automated cluster management and IPython-style
notebooks. In November 2017, the company was announced as a first-party service
on Microsoft Azure via the integration Azure Databricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-slack&quot;&gt;What is Slack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is a proprietary business communication platform developed by American
software company Slack Technologies. Slack offers many IRC-style features,
including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups,
and direct messaging. For more information, you can find them &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-create-a-date-pipeline-with-azure-data-factory-and-databricks&quot;&gt;How to create a date pipeline with Azure Data Factory and Databricks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before beginning, you need to have/create a Databricks workspace, prepare the
Python notebook that you want to execute using Azure Data Factory. We have 2
main steps for automating the execution of notebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a data pipeline in Azure Data Factory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a trigger for running a pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-data-pipeline-in-azure-data-factory&quot;&gt;Create a data pipeline in Azure Data Factory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t show more details for the step, since you can find them in this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/transform-data-using-databricks-notebook&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; as the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a data factory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a pipeline that uses Databricks Notebook Activity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trigger a pipeline run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitor the pipeline run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-trigger-for-running-a-pipeline&quot;&gt;Create a trigger for running a pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triggers represent a unit of processing that determines when a pipeline
execution needs to be kicked off. Currently, Data Factory supports three types
of triggers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/how-to-create-schedule-trigger&quot;&gt;Schedule trigger&lt;/a&gt;: A trigger that invokes a pipeline on a
wall-clock schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/how-to-create-tumbling-window-trigger&quot;&gt;Tumbling window trigger&lt;/a&gt;: A trigger that operates
on a periodic interval, while also retaining state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Event-based trigger: A trigger that responds to an event, like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/how-to-create-event-trigger&quot;&gt;a storage event&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/how-to-create-custom-event-trigger&quot;&gt;a custom event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same as above, you can find all tutorials with the links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-communicate-data-pipelines-result-on-slack&quot;&gt;How to communicate data pipeline’s result on Slack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack provides a range of &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/apis&quot;&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; that provide access to read, write,
and update many types of data in Slack. To communicate data pipeline’s result on
Slack, we can send messages to a channel or upload files on a channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;slack-apis&quot;&gt;Slack APIs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;send-messages-to-a-channel&quot;&gt;Send messages to a channel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chat.postMessage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for posting a message to a
public channel, private channel, or direct message/IM channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A request is an HTTP URL of the following form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-http highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with certain arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;token&lt;/code&gt;: (Required) Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens
should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;
parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;channel&lt;/code&gt;: (Required) Channel, private group, or IM channel to send message
to. Can be an encoded ID, or a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About more information of arguments, you can find them &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;upload-files&quot;&gt;Upload files&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/methods/files.upload&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;files.upload&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for creating or uploading an existing
file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A request is an HTTP URL of the following form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-http highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;POST https://slack.com/api/files.upload
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with certain arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;token&lt;/code&gt;: (Required) Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens
should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;
parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About more information of arguments, you can find them &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/methods/files.upload&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-find-channel-id-on-slack&quot;&gt;How to find channel ID on Slack?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send messages or upload files to a public channel, a multi-person direct
message or a direct message to someone, we need to get the channel ID, but where
can we find them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-public-channels-id&quot;&gt;The public channel’s ID&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we open Slack with navigator, we can find it in the URL, with the following
format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://app.slack.com/client/TD123ABCD/C024BE91L
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of the URL(&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;C024BE91L&lt;/code&gt;) above starts with “C”, which presents
the public channel’s ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-multi-person-direct-messages-id&quot;&gt;The multi-person direct message’s ID&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar as above, let’s open Slack with navigator, we can find it in the URL,
with the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://app.slack.com/client/TD123ABCD/G012AC86C
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of the URL(&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;G012AC86C&lt;/code&gt;) above starts with “G”, which presents
the group’s ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-users-id&quot;&gt;The user’s ID&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a User’s ID, we can find it both on the website or the application. When we
check someone’s profile, we can find the ID (starts with “U”) by clicking
“More”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-realise-it-via-python&quot;&gt;How to realise it via Python?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;send-messages-to-a-channel-1&quot;&gt;Send messages to a channel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can send the messages with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requests.post()&lt;/code&gt; by specify the token,
the channel ID and message that you want to send.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;token&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;as-123dfghj456-klqwert7y8u9iop&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;channel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;U012AB34C&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent a message “test” with Databricks Message Bot on Slack, and received a
message as below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210427-slack-send-msg&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210427-slack-send-msg.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;upload-files-1&quot;&gt;Upload files&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can upload the file with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requests.post()&lt;/code&gt; by specify the file path, the
token, the channel ID and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;initial_comment&lt;/code&gt; if you want to introduce the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://slack.com/api/files.upload&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;filename&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/of/file&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;file&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/of/file&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;splitext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;basename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/of/file&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:])}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I talked about how to create and automate a data pipeline on Azure
Data Factory, how to send messages and upload files on Slack with its APIs. Hope
it’s helpful for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retailing domain, one of the most important things is increasing the customer
satifaction and the customer loyalty. To reach the goals, we need to understand
CRM (Customer Relationship Management) firstly, then we can take steps to
improve them. In this blog, I’ll talk about this with the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is CRM ?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does CRM help retailers ?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applications in retailing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CRM application in other industries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-crm-&quot;&gt;What is CRM ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to the principles, practices, and
guidelines that an organization follows when interacting with its customers.
From the organization’s point of view, this entire relationship encompasses
direct interactions with customers, such as sales and service-related processes,
forecasting, and the analysis of customer trends and behaviors. Ultimately, CRM
serves to enhance the customer’s overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-crm-help-retailers-&quot;&gt;How does CRM help retailers ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.sap.com/what-is-crm/&quot;&gt;SAP INSIGHTS&lt;/a&gt; shows us five biggest benefits of CRM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved customer experience:&lt;/strong&gt; Give contact center reps and field service
technicians a 360° view of customers – so they can deliver personalized customer
experiences and resolve issues quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased customer retention:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow your customers with personalized service
that wins loyalty. Run real-time analytics to identify the best offers, the
right timing, and the optimal channel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher sales revenue:&lt;/strong&gt; Boost pipeline visibility and sell more – with
integrated tools for sales force automation, lead management, forecasting,
cross-selling, e-commerce, and more. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater process efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Help your sales, marketing, and service teams
accomplish more with less effort – by taking advantage of automated processes
and scheduled follow-up prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work smarter – better collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; Share information across teams,
departments, and internal and external stakeholders with collaborative CRM – to
better serve customers at every touchpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;applications-in-retailing&quot;&gt;Applications in retailing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khalifa, Mohamed, and Ning Shen [1] developped, operationalized and empirically
tested a temporal model explaining the relationship between three categories
of eCRM (i.e., pre-purchase, at-purchase and post-purchase eCRM) and online
customer satisfaction at two phases of the customer lifecycle, i.e., attraction
and retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They used the customer lifecycle framework to conceptualize satisfaction and
relied on the transaction cycle to classify eCRM features. Their research model
identifies the important features for three types of eCRM, i.e., pre-purchase,
at-purchase, and post-purchase eCRM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pre-purchase eCRM features
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Site customization&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Customer education&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Alternative channels&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Loyalty program membership&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Search capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At-purchase eCRM features
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Product customization&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Payment methods&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Purchase conditions&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Comparative shopping&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dynamic pricing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post-purchase eCRM features
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Online sale of spare parts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Problem solving&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Feedback channels&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Order tracking&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Online community&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Web center&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their research found that the significance and magnitude of the effects of
product customization, website customization and dynamic pricing reflect the
perceived importance of eCRM activities that are intended to support the
one-to-one paradigm shift: transforming the relationship between the firm and
the customer from a one-to-many mode into a one-to-one mode. Other eCRM drivers
of customer satisfaction include alerts, search capabilities, order tracking and
problem solving. They represent another transformation of the relationship
between the firm and the customer: from passive to active. Another significant
variable, i.e., online community, is intended for yet another paradigm shift:
many-to-many marketing, where the customers are involved in providing value to
each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Khalid Rababah, Haslina Mohd, and Huda Ibrahim [3] suggested an
important step before the implementation of CRM programs/systems, which is the
creation and communication of customer-oriented culture within the
organizational. The purpose of this step is to be as a pre-implementation plan
for CRM programs/systems in which, a better understanding of the concept of CRM
and the sense and awareness of the CRM program/system are created within the
organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crm-application-in-other-industries&quot;&gt;CRM application in other industries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except the application of CRM in retailing, CRM is also important in many other
industries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Banking: Due to the tough competition in the banking industry in Jordan, it is
very necessary for financial institutions to build and maintain a strong
relationship with the customers in order to achieve the ultimate goal of
customer satisfaction. The statistical analysis of Azzam, K [4] revealed that
there is a significant relationship between the independent variables(i.e., CRM
elements represented by service quality, employee’s behavior, customer data
base, solving customer problems physical environment; and social network
interaction) and customer satisfaction as a dependent variable in the services
banking industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education: The study of Olaleke, Oluseye Olaleke, Tairat Taiye Taiye, and
Emmanuel Olumide Olumide [5] explored the ways in which student satisfaction can
be achieved with the use of customer relationship management. Their research
findings showed that student’s willingness to recommend to others increases when
the student lifecycle in the university is well managed. It was also discovered
that strong parent relationship management at the University enhances the
student’s  willingness to recommend their Universities to others. It is
therefore recommended that Universities should adopt effective customer
relationship management strategies to achieve student satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile telecom: With the expansive growth of mobile commerce come
opportunities for business and mobile service providers. To distinguish its
service from another’s and build a loyal customer base, a mobile service
provider must look beyond technology and appeal to their customers’
individuality through CRM. A study of Chen, Ja-Shen, and Russell KH Ching [6]
examined the relationships of CRM practices and mobile services with customer
loyalty, and the moderating effects of brand image was conducted. The results
suggest that all contribute to loyalty. However, brand image moderates the
relationships of customer service and customization, and mobile usage with
customer loyalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog talked about what is CRM and its 5 biggest benefits, it also presented
the application in retailing and other industies, such as banking, education and
mobile telecom. Hope it’s useful for you!&lt;/p&gt;

multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand
identified through a supply chain. Most modern retailers typically make a
variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to
be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services
and the store’s overall market positioning. To point retailers in the right
direction, they need to dig the retail metrics and KPIs to track in their
business. In this blog, I’ll talk about the following pretty helpful KPIs for
retailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turnover per square foot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Year over year growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer retention rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inventory turnover vs sell-through rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Break-Even Point&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back Order Rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;turnover-per-square-foot&quot;&gt;Turnover per square foot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/retail-industry-metrics-kpis&quot;&gt;Tableau&lt;/a&gt;, we find that the turnover per square foot measures
how effectively you’re using the area you have, and it is a good indicator of
your store’s productivity while offering insights into store and merchandise
layouts. If some product categories perform better than others, it may because
of the types of products or their arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Turnover per square foot = Total turnover / Total square foot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vendhq.com/blog/retail-metrics-and-kpis/&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/a&gt; presents some tips for improving our turnover per square
foot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve your store layout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a winning product assortment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimize your prices or promotions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase transaction or basket value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Train your staff to sell more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage people to stay longer in your shop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210202-turnover-per-square-foot&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210202-turnover-per-square-foot.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the turnover per square foot of 4 kinds of products during one
day, the value for the wine is higher than others since they are put on the
multi-layer shelves, which is a good example of using spaces. Fruits’ turnover
per square foot is the lowest among the four, because its unit price is lower,
although its space utilization is better than the shelves of butchery and
seafood. For the other two kinds of products, their space utilization is not
enough, but their unit price is high, so their turnovers per square are not that
low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;year-over-year-growth&quot;&gt;Year over year growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year-over-year growth is a comparison of a retail metric for one period to the
same period the previous year. It calculates the percentage change during the
past twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Year Over Year Growth = (Current year sales total – Previous year’s sales total) / Previous year’s sales total x 100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ehopper.com/guides/kpi-retail/&quot;&gt;ehopper&lt;/a&gt; shows us an example that can help us to understand why the year
over year growth is an important retail metric. Imagine that the retail revenue
was up 20% in November concerning October, besides, you also need to check this
number against the revenue from last November. If it’s also greater than the
revenue of last November, that means your business is doing better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210202-year-over-year-growth&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210202-year-over-year-growth.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the turnover and the year over year growth for each month, which
helps us to identify if the increase of turnover is also significant vs. the
last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customer-retention-rate&quot;&gt;Customer retention rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to attract new customers and to let them return is a relatively
stable source for long-term profit. To understand if we have this source in our
business, we can track the number of new customers versus repeat customers, and
calculate the customer retention rate. There is a formula to calculate this KPI
on the site of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/retail-industry-metrics-kpis&quot;&gt;Tableau&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Customer retention rate = ((Total distinct customers at end of period) - (Total new distinct customers acquired during period)) / (Total distinct customers at start of period) x 100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vendhq.com/blog/retail-metrics-and-kpis/&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/a&gt; presents some tips to improve our customer retention
rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tracking customer purchases and offering personalized recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing meaningful relationships through amazing customer service as well
as community-building efforts like classes, events, or online groups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementing a killer loyalty program to encourage shoppers to keep coming
back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210202-user-retention&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210202-user-retention.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I take the example of Google Analytics of my blog, the idea is similar for
e-commerce or physical stores. During the last 6 weeks, only 2.7% of visitors of
week 0 were back in week 1, 0.9% were back in week 2, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inventory-turnover-vs-sell-through-rate&quot;&gt;Inventory turnover vs sell-through rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;inventory-turnover&quot;&gt;Inventory turnover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accounting, the Inventory turnover is a measure of the number of times
inventory is sold or used in a period such as a year. It is calculated to see if
a business has an excessive inventory in comparison to its sales level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inventory Turnover = Net sales / Average inventory at the selling price
or
Inventory Turnover = Cost of good sold / Average inventory at cost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Average inventory = (Beginning inventory + Ending inventory) / 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210202-inventory-turnover&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210202-inventory-turnover.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The target inventory turnover of 2020 is 2.7, which means the net sales is twice
more than the average inventory at the selling price. Because of the lockdown,
the sales had a high increase. which brings a high inventory turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sell-through-rate&quot;&gt;Sell-through rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell-through rate refers to the percentage of a product that is sold by a
retailer after being shipped by its supplier, typically expressed as a
percentage. Sell-through is calculated during a period (usually 1 month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sell-Through Rate = Units Sold / Units Received&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine that you are the manager of a supermarket, you ordered
100 boxes of chocolate, but after 1 month only 20 boxes are sold, in this case,
the sell-through rate is 20%, which means other 80% of chocolate are there for
gathering dust :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210202-sell-through-rate&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210202-sell-through-rate.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these 7 kinds of products, sushi’s sell-through rate is the highest since
they can nearly all be sold the same day; on the contrary, the sell-through rate
of the wine is lower than others since it’s not the daily aliment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;break-even-point&quot;&gt;Break-Even Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Break-even (or break even), often abbreviated as B/E in finance, is the point of
balance making neither a profit nor a loss. Any number below the break-even
point constitutes a loss while any number above it shows a profit. The term
originates in finance but the concept has been applied in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Break-Even ($) = Fixed Costs / Gross Margin Percentage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210202-break-even&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210202-break-even.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-order-rate&quot;&gt;Back Order Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The back order rate is the ratio between the number of orders that cannot be
fulfilled at the moment the customer places an order and the total number of
orders. A high back order rate means that your customers have to wait for more
longer than assumed, which might have an impact on customers’ satisfaction and
the customer retention rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datapine.com/kpi-examples-and-templates/retail&quot;&gt;datapine&lt;/a&gt; inserts this KPI into their dashboard to help retailers to
measure the ability to fulfill customer orders, to identify why the related
product has no enough stock, and to avoid the same problem in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand
identified through a supply chain. Most modern retailers typically make a
variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to
be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services
and the store’s overall market positioning. To point retailers in the right
direction, they need to dig the retail metrics and KPIs to track in their
business. In this blog, I’ll talk about the following pretty helpful KPIs for
retailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volume of transactions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turnover of transactions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transactions amount&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average volume per transaction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average purchase value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purchase frequency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gross profit vs net profit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gross Margin Return On Investment (GMROI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;volume-of-transactions&quot;&gt;Volume of transactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datapine.com/kpi-examples-and-templates/retail&quot;&gt;datapine&lt;/a&gt; uses this indicator in their dashboard. Transactions’ volume
measures the number of units sold during a specific accounting period. It can
help you to understand if some products are sold more than others in different
periods or different zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210117-vol-trx&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210117-vol-trx.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot describes the volume(k) for each fruit. Among four fruits, bananas’
sales are the largest (34k units), however, it seems that consumers don’t like
apple that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;turnover-of-transactions&quot;&gt;Turnover of transactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datapine.com/kpi-examples-and-templates/retail&quot;&gt;datapine&lt;/a&gt; uses this indicator in their dashboard. Transactions’ turnover
measures the value of sales during a specific period. It can help you to
understand if some products bring more value than others in different periods or
different zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210117-turnover-trx&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210117-turnover-trx.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot compares two-year turnover together. The peak for both year is in the
summer, for year N, the peak is in August; however, the peak is reached in June
in the year N-1, which is caused by the heatwave in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transactions-amount&quot;&gt;Transactions amount&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty straightforward metric that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datapine.com/kpi-examples-and-templates/retail&quot;&gt;datapine&lt;/a&gt; uses in their
dashboard. The transaction amount calculates how many orders have been placed
in your business over the day, month or year. It will help you in knowing when
the peak periods are and adapt your stock inventory accordingly, to avoid any
stock-out or backorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210117-trx-amount&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210117-trx-amount.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this plot, it’s obvious that the peak in a day is around noon and
after work like 19h, because customers work in the morning and afternoon, they
have time to shopping during the noon and after work. Moreover, there are 2
small peaks around 9h and 16h, that might because customer come to buy their
breakfast and classes over around 16h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;average-volume-per-transaction&quot;&gt;Average volume per transaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ehopper.com/guides/kpi-retail/&quot;&gt;eHopper&lt;/a&gt; talks about this indicator on their website. We can measure this
KPI to track things like product sales over time, it helps us to ascertain if an
increasing turnover means you are selling more products, or if customers are
buying more costly products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Average volume per transaction = Total transaction volume / Transactions amount&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210117-avg-vol-trx&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210117-avg-vol-trx.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the average volume per transaction of ice-cream. Logically, the
volume increases with temperature increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;average-purchase-value&quot;&gt;Average purchase value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://toucantoco.com/blog/en/kpis-retail-manager/&quot;&gt;toucantoco&lt;/a&gt; talks about this indicator in his blog. Average purchase value
measures the average value of each transaction made by customers. Retailers can
understand sales’ trend with this measure, they can also combine it with average
volume per sale to ascertain if an increasing turnover means you are selling
more products, or if customers are buying more costly products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Average purchase value = Total purchase value / Transactions amount&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;20210117-avg-trx-value&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210117-avg-trx-value.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot describes the average volume and average value per sale during 12
months. We find that when the average volume per sale increases, the average
value does not always increase. For instance, the average volume of April is
more than March, but the average value is less, which means customers buy more
units during their purchase, but the price per unit is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;purchase-frequency&quot;&gt;Purchase frequency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchase frequency measures how many times a customer does purchase during a
given period. The evolution of the purchase frequency does not represent
directly the sales’ value becomes more or less, we should understand it with
some other KPIs like average volume per transaction or average purchase value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Purchase frequency&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210117-purchase-frequency.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that this plot shows the performance of some supermarkets in France
in 2020. The purchase frequency reduces because of the lockdown for COVID-19,
however, the average value per sale doubles. Thus, although the frequency
reduces, the total turnover doesn’t become less by analysing the average value
per sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gross-profit-vs-net-profit&quot;&gt;Gross profit vs net profit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehopper.com/guides/kpi-retail/&quot;&gt;eHopper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vendhq.com/blog/retail-metrics-and-kpis/&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/a&gt; talk about these 2 KPIs. The gross profit
tells you how much you made after deducting the costs of creating and selling
the product. The net profit tells you how much you made after deducting your
cost of goods along with all other business expenses — including administrative
costs, operating expenses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;gross profit = total revenue – cost of goods sold (COGS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;net profit = gross profit – all expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gross profit and net profit help you to understand your business and to make
better decisions. For example, if your gross profit is much higher than net
profit, you can look into your operating expenses or all other expenses, and
check if they are reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gross-margin-return-on-investment-gmroi&quot;&gt;Gross Margin Return On Investment (GMROI)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/retail-industry-metrics-kpis&quot;&gt;tableau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datapine.com/kpi-examples-and-templates/retail&quot;&gt;datapine&lt;/a&gt; talk about these 2 KPIs. Gross Margin
Return on Investment (GMROI) measures your profit return on the funds invested
in the stock. What this means in practice is that for every euro you spend in
your stock, this KPI can tell you how many euros you get back so that you apply
it on specified products to measure if they are worth stocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;GMROI = gross profit / average inventory cost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;GMROI&quot; src=&quot;/images/20210117-GMROI.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot describes the GMROI of 3 groups of products (cleaning products, staple
products and fruits) of 2020. All of them increase since March because of the
COVID-19 lockdown, customers were willing to buy more cleaning products to keep
clean, to buy more staple products and fruits since they need to cook at home
and to keep the dietary balance.&lt;/p&gt;
