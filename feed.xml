<p>During the recent work, I need to write data into PostgreSQL database. Before writing real data on staging, I learnt how to do it with Docker. In this blog, I’ll talk about this with the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is PostgreSQL?</li>
  <li>Why Docker?</li>
  <li>Create a database and tables with Docker container</li>
  <li>Insert data with Python</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-postgresql">What is PostgreSQL?</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that
uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store
and scale the most complicated data workloads. PostgreSQL comes with many
features aimed to help developers build applications, administrators to protect
data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your
data no matter how big or small the dataset. In addition to being free and open
source, PostgreSQL is highly extensible. For example, you can define your own
data types, build out custom functions, even write code from different
programming languages without recompiling your database!</p>

<h2 id="why-docker">Why Docker?</h2>
<p>Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple
languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools
for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and
accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with
their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each
project.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-database-and-tables-with-docker-container">Create a database and tables with Docker container</h2>
<p>Here, I used the official docker image of <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/">postgres</a> to
create a database and tables.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-database">Create a database</h3>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE DATABASE xxx;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20220514-create-db" src="/images/20220514-create-db.png" />
</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table">Create a table</h3>
<p>We can create a table with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-createtable.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE TABLE</code></a> and insert value
into it with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSERT INTO table_name (column_name) VALUES (values)</code></a>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE jsonb_test (
    id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    parameters jsonb
);
INSERT INTO jsonb_test ("parameters") VALUES ('{"param1":"value1","param2":22,"param3":[3,33]}');
</code></pre></div></div>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20220514-create-table-insert-values" src="/images/20220514-create-table-insert-values.png" />
</p>

<h3 id="deletion">Deletion</h3>
<p>To delete data in a table with conditions or data a whole table, we can use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE FROM table_name WHERE xxx;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE FROM table_name</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DROP TABLE tb_name</code>.</p>

<h2 id="insert-data-with-python">Insert data with Python</h2>
<p>Here, I used the official docker images of <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python">python3</a>.
Now we will insert a pandas dataframe <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf</code> into the table <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonb_test</code>:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20220514-table-jsonb" src="/images/20220514-table-jsonb.png" />
</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sqlalchemy</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">create_engine</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pd</span>

<span class="n">pdf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">DataFrame</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s">'parameters'</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="s">'{"param1":"v1", "param2": 2}'</span><span class="p">]})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20220514-create-pandas-df" src="/images/20220514-create-pandas-df.png" />
</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>eng_pg = create_engine("postgresql://postgres:{pw}@{host}/pgdb".format(pw=PASSWORD],
                                                                       host=HOST_NAME))
pdf.to_sql("jsonb_test", eng_pg, if_exists='append', index=False)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Before inserting the dataframe into PGSQL, we need to create a PGSQL engine with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_engine</code> by specifying the host name and password, then insert the
dataframe with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">to_sql</code>.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20220514-create-engine" src="/images/20220514-create-engine.png" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20220514-check-table" src="/images/20220514-check-table.png" />
</p>

<p>With the check above, we can ensure that we insert the dataframe successfully.</p>

It is located
in the north-central part of the country and often called the Région Parisienne
(“Paris Region”) because it includes the city of Paris. Besides the landmarks of
Paris, the region has many important historic sites, including the Palace of
Versailles and the Palace of Fontainebleau, as well as the most-visited tourist
attraction in France, Disneyland Paris. The poverty rate in Île-de-France was
15.9% in 2015, compared with 12.3% in 2006. The region is also increasingly
unequal. Housing prices have pushed the less affluent outside Paris. In this
blog, I’ll talk about the second-hand apartments purchases in Île-de-France
between January 2014 and June 2021, with the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data description</li>
  <li>How large are the apartments?</li>
  <li>Which is the most expensive district?</li>
  <li>Relationship between area &amp; apartment price?</li>
  <li>Price evolution in terms of timing?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-description">Data description</h2>
<p>First of all, I downloaded real estate transactions’ data on the <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/5c4ae55a634f4117716d5656/">site of
government</a>. In the dataset, we have transaction’s information
from January 2014 to June 2021, like “nature_mutation” specifies the sale’s
nature, “nombre_pieces_principales” indicates the number of rooms,
“valeur_fonciere” presents the sold price, “code_commune”, “nom_commune” and
“code_departement” specify the communities and departments,
“surface_reelle_bati” describes the real surface area.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="vf.info()" src="/images/20220103-vf.png" />
</p>

<p>For this analysis, I only took account of second-hand apartments’ transactions
with a positive area in Île-de-France.</p>

<h2 id="how-large-are-the-apartments">How large are the apartments?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="QP piece number" src="/images/20220103-quotepart-piece-number.png" />
</p>

<p>I classed second-hand apartments into 5 groups in terms of piece’s number: T1,
which means one-room apartment with around 25 m2; T2, which means two-room
apartment with around 40 m2; T3 presents three-room apartment around 60 m2; T4
are four-room apartments nearly 80 m2; T5 are five-room apartments larger than
100 m2. This donut chart describes the quote-part of different pieces’
apartment among the transactions. T2 and T3 hold nearly 60% of transactions,
nearly 17% of transactions sold T1 apartments, other purchases are for larger
apartments. Let’s go further on the details.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Unit price for different piece number" src="/images/20220103-unit-price-piece-number.png" />
</p>

<p>This graph describes the average price m2 for different numbers of piece second-hand apartments in Ile-de-France, between January 2014 and June 2021. I classed second-hand apartments into 5 groups in terms of piece’s number: T1, which means one-room apartment with around 25 m2; T2, which means two-room apartment with around 40 m2; T3 presents three-room apartment around 60 m2; T4 are four-room apartments nearly 80 m2; T5 are five-room apartments larger than 100 m2. The average area of each class is similar in different departments. For the T1 and T2 apartments, the ones in Paris are smaller than other departments; however, the second-hand apartments of T4 or larger ones are larger than other departments.</p>

<p>According to the second graph, we find that although T2 and T3 are much larger than T1, their unit prices are lower than the unit price of T1: the gap in Paris is 6.7% and 6.3%, respectively, to T1; the gap in other departments is pretty large (12% and 23%). Moreover, the average area of T4 is three times larger than T1, its unit price is 20% less expensive than T1 on average; except for Paris, T4’s unit price is 1% less expensive than T1 in Paris. Why are T1 apartments that expensive per m2? That might be because there are many students or young workers, they need to rent a big enough apartment, which makes investors invest in T1 apartments, which also leads to higher demands on T1.</p>

<h2 id="which-is-the-most-expensive-department">Which is the most expensive department?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="District price" src="/images/20220103-district-price.png" />
</p>

<p>According to this map, we observe that the second-hand apartments in the center and west of Paris are more expensive( &gt; 8.5k euros per m2) than other districts of Paris(6k - 8.5k euros per m2), the second-hand apartments in Paris are more expensive than other departments of IDF. Among the departments except for Paris, the second-hand apartments in Hauts-de-Seine are more expensive(4k - 6k euros per m2).</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the light of the stacked bar chart, it’s obvious that there are much more transactions in Paris, although it’s much more expensive than other departments, no matter which class of apartments. In Paris, 60% of transactions sold studio or 2-room apartments; but in other departments, the majority of transactions sold 2-room or 3-room apartments. One of the reasons might be the unit price in Paris is more expensive, the studio or 2-room apartment can satisfy the needs of people who live alone or in couple and satisfy the need of investors; on the contrary, people who live with family prefer the apartments outside Paris, they are larger and less expensive.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Unit price per piece nb in different districts" src="/images/20220103-unit-price-piece-number-district.png" />
</p>

<h2 id="relationship-between-area--apartment-price">Relationship between area &amp; apartment price?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Relationship between area and apartment price in different districts" src="/images/20220103-area-price-district.png" />
</p>

<p>According to this group of scatter plots, we can simply get the relationship between second-hand apartments’ price and their area. Each point stands for one transaction, the plots on the red dash line mean that the price per m2 of these transactions is 10k euros. The points above the dashed line indicate their unit price is greater than 10k euros; otherwise, it’s less than 10k euros per m2.</p>

<p>For the transactions in Paris, most of the sold apartments are smaller than 150 m2, the unit price is around 10k euros per m2. However, for the transaction in other departments, most of the apartments are smaller than 130 m2, the unit price is lower than 10k euros per m2; especially in Seine-et-Marne(77), Essonne(91) and Val-d’Oise(95), we can even get a 100 m2 second-hand apartment with only 0.25 million euros, which is much cheaper than other departments.</p>

<h2 id="price-evolution-in-terms-of-timing">Price evolution in terms of timing?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Tx amount &amp; unit price evolution 14-20" src="/images/20220103-transaction-amount-unit-price-1420.png" />
</p>

<p>The line chart describes the second-hand apartments’ average price per m2 of Ile-de-France, between January 2014 and June 2021. Obviously, the average price in Paris is the highest in Ile-de-France and its evolution is the highest as well, which increased 37%(11.5/8.4 - 1). Besides, the average price in Hauts-de-Seine is the second-highest in Ile-de-France, it increased 33% (7.3/5.5-1); the average price in Val-de-Marne increased 31% (5.5/4.2-1); the average price of other departments in Ile-de-France doesn’t change a lot. Among 8 departments, the second-hand apartments are the most expensive in Paris until June 2021, which is 11.3k euros per m2, it’s 55% higher than the price in Hauts-de-Seine and twice more expensive than second-hand apartments in Val-de-Marne.</p>

<p>The stacked area plot presents the second-hand apartments transaction amount of Ile-de-France, during the same period as the line chart. We can easily find that the transaction amount of Paris’ second-hand apartments is more than other departments of IDF, which is nearly 30% of transactions in IDF. Following Paris, the transaction amount of Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne are the second and third greatest of IDF. The peak of Paris’s transaction is December 2015 (4612 transactions), for Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne is July 2019.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Time series decomposition" src="/images/20220103-time-series-idf.png" />
</p>

<p>Then I used Time Series <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">additive</code> model to decompose data into a trend
component, a seasonal component, and a residual component. The trend component
captures changes over time, the seasonal component captures cyclical effects
due to the time of year, the residual component captures the influences not
described by the trend and seasonal effects. Thanks to this model, we find that
except for July, there is another transaction peak in March, which we didn’t
find above. In June and August, the transactions arrive at their low points,
that might be because, during the transition period between 2 months, the desire
for purchasing or selling apartments is not that high.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Unit price prediction" src="/images/20220103-price-prediction-idf.png" />
</p>

<p>Moreover, I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fbprophet</code> module to predict the price per m2. The black
points present actual values, the blue line indicates the forecasted values, and
the light blue shaded region is the uncertainty. The uncertainty’s region
increases for the prediction because of the initial uncertainty and it grows
over time. This can be impacted by policy, social elements, or some others.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>According to this analysis, we find that among all transactions of second-hand
apartments in Île-de-France, T2 and T3 hold 60% transactions. The second-hand
apartments in the center and west of Paris are more expensive(&gt; 8.5k euros per
m2) than other arrondissements of Paris(6k - 8.5k euros per m2), the second-hand
apartments in Paris are more expensive than other departments of IDF. Among the
departments except for Paris, the second-hand apartments in Hauts-de-Seine are
more expensive(4k - 6k euros per m2).</p>

Since the 17th century,
Paris has been one of Europe’s major centers of finance, diplomacy, commerce,
fashion, science, and the arts. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit
Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive
city in the world, after Singapore, and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo and
Geneva. Another source ranked Paris as the most expensive, on a par with
Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018. All these elements help to bring the
increasing price of real estate in Paris. In this blog, I’ll talk about the
second-hand apartments purchases in Paris between January 2014 and June 2021,
with the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data description</li>
  <li>How large are the apartments?</li>
  <li>Which is the most expensive arrondissement?</li>

<h2 id="how-large-are-the-apartments">How large are the apartments?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="QP piece number" src="/images/20220102-quotepart-piece-number.png" />
</p>

<p>I classed second-hand apartments into 5 groups in terms of piece’s number: T1,
which means one-room apartment with around 23 m2; T2, which means two-room
apartment with around 40 m2; T3 presents three-room apartment around 63 m2; T4
are four-room apartments nearly 93 m2; T5 are five-room apartments with a larger
area of about 147 m2. This donut chart describes the quote-part of different
pieces’ apartments among the transactions. T1 and T2 hold 60% transactions, 22%
transactions sold T3 apartments, other purchases are for larger apartments.
Let’s go further on the details.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Unit price for different piece number" src="/images/20220102-unit-price-piece-number.png" />
</p>

<p>This graph describes the average price m2 for the different number of piece
second-hand apartments in Paris, between January 2014 and June 2021. According
to the second graph, we find that although T2 and T3 are much larger than T1,
their unit prices are 6.7% and 6.4% lower than the unit price of T1. Moreover,
the average area of T4 is three times larger than T1, its unit price is only 4%
more expensive than T1; similar for other piece-number apartments. Why are T1
apartments that expensive per m2? That might be because there are many students
or young workers in Paris, they need to rent a big enough apartment, which makes
investors invest in T1 apartments, which also leads to higher demands on T1.</p>

<h2 id="which-is-the-most-expensive-arrondissement">Which is the most expensive arrondissement?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="arrondissement price" src="/images/20220102-district-price.png" />
</p>

<p>According to this map, we observe that the second-hand apartments in
arrondissements 4, 6, 7, 8 are much more expensive than other arrondissements,
their average unit price is at least 11800 euros; on the contrary, the
second-hand apartments in arrondissements 18, 19 and 20 are much cheaper than
others, their average unit price is less than 8000 euros. This might be caused
by geographical positions, number of pieces, apartment’s state, the performance
of energy, public security, etc. The public transport in the city center is more
than in other areas, there are also lots of shopping centers or tourist spots,
which attracts plenty of people, so that makes the city center to be more
valuable.</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to the stacked bar plot below, it’s obvious that there
are much more transactions in the 18th arrondissement than in other areas, nearly
50% sold apartments are 2-room apartments. The Sacré-Cœur Basilica and Montmartre
make the 18th arrondissement famous. A real neighborhood of artists, it is
bohemian and cosmopolitan. If you like discovering atypical places and diverse
personalities, you will find what you’re looking for. You will discover the
popular flea market, many schools and many nightlife venues, such as cabarets
around Pigalle. All these attract couples to live in the 18th arrondissement.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the 16th arrondissement, the transaction amount of T4 is pretty
larger than all other arrondissements. Paris 16 is eminently residential, as
evidenced by its charming buildings with green courtyards and balconies. But it
is also a Parisian cultural hotspot with many museums and emblematic places from
both a historical and intellectual point of view. Moreover, it concentrates many
schools and establishments of choice for the education of children and students.
All these might be the reason why the transactions of T4 in Paris 16 are much
more than other arrondissements.</p>

<p>For the arrondissements as 1st, 2nd or 3rd arrondissement, more than one third
of sold apartments are T1 apartments, that might be because there is not that
many apartments at the center of Paris, and its unit price is high.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Transaction amount for different arrondissements" src="/images/20220102-trx-nb-piece-number-district.png" />
</p>

<h2 id="relationship-between-area--apartment-price">Relationship between area &amp; apartment price?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Relationship between area and apartment price in different arrondissements" src="/images/20220102-area-price-district.png" />
</p>

<p>According to this group of scatter plots, we can simply get the relationship
between second-hand apartments’ price and their area. Each point stands for one
transaction, the plots on the red dash line mean that the price per m2 of these
transactions is 10k euros. The points above the dashed line indicate their unit
price is greater than 10k euros; otherwise, it’s less than 10k euros per m2.</p>

<p>For the transactions of the downtown area, most of them are smaller than 50 m2,
but their price varies widely to nearly 2 million euros; on the other hand, for
the 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissement, many sold apartments’ price also arrive
more than 2 million euros, but their area varies widely to 200 m2; moreover,
there are also apartments whose unit price and area don’t vary that widely, as
in 13th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissement, most of the apartments here are
smaller than 100 m2 and cheaper than 1 million euros, so than less than 10k
euros per m2.</p>

<h2 id="price-evolution-in-terms-of-timing">Price evolution in terms of timing?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Tx amount &amp; unit price evolution 14-21" src="/images/20220102-transaction-amount-unit-price-1421.png" />
</p>

<p>This graph describes second-hand apartments’ transaction amount and average price per m2 of Paris, between January 2014 and June 2021. The orange line shows the monthly average price per m2, the blue area displays the monthly transaction amount. During 7.5 years, the average price per m2 increases 37% (11.5/8.4 - 1), especially from the year 2017, the average price per m2 increases nearly 26% (11.5/9.1 - 1). Moreover, the transaction amount arrives at the yearly lowest point in August, which might be because people go on holiday at that time; on the contrary, the transactions in July or September are higher than other months, which means that people usually sign the purchase promise in May or July (supposed that we have 2 months for negotiating the credit between the purchase promise and purchase agreement), so that they can sign the agreement before their holiday or before the school opening. Moreover, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the transaction amount dropped 50% in April 2020, then it reverted after the first confinement ended. Impacted by the pandemic, both transaction amount and average price didn’t increase a lot in 2021.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Time series decomposition" src="/images/20220102-time-series-paris.png" />
</p>

<p>Then I used Time Series <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">additive</code> model to decompose data into a trend
component, a seasonal component, and a residual component. The trend component
captures changes over time, the seasonal component captures cyclical effects due
to the time of year, the residual component captures the influences not
described by the trend and seasonal effects. Thanks to this model, we find that
except for July, there is another transaction peak in January, which we didn’t
find above. In March and June, the transactions arrive at their low points,
that might be because, during the transition period between 2 months, the desire
for purchasing or selling apartments is not that high.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Unit price prediction" src="/images/20220102-price-prediction-paris.png" />
</p>

<p>Moreover, I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fbprophet</code> module to predict the price per m2. The black
points present actual values, the blue line indicates the forecasted values,
and the light blue shaded region is the uncertainty. The uncertainty’s region
increases for the prediction because of the initial uncertainty and it grows
over time. This can be impacted by policy, social elements, or some others.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>According to this analysis, we find that among all transactions of second-hand
apartments in Paris, T1 and T2 hold 60% transactions. The second-hand apartments
in arrondissements 4, 6, 7 and 8 are much more expensive than other
arrondissements, their average unit price is at least 11800 euros; on the
contrary, the second-hand apartments in arrondissements 18, 19 and 20 are much
cheaper than others, their average unit price is less than 8000 euros.</p>

<p>The year 2021 is still a year battling with COVID-19. Thanks to the vaccination,
our life gradually returns to normal, we started to back to the office more
frequently and had the chance to travel as before. This year I continue to go
deeper on how to apply data science to the retailing domain and do some data
analysis with open-source data as well. In this blog, I’ll resume my year of
2021 with the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Working in retailing (In The Memory)</li>
  <li>COVID-19 analysis</li>
  <li>Blogs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-in-retailing-in-the-memory">Working in retailing (In The Memory)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.inthememory.com/?lang=en">In The Memory</a> is a retail-tech company that helps retail players to
make the best use of the different internal and external data sources to meet
their strategic and operational business challenges. Our products allow
distributors and brands to accelerate their decision-making to attract more
customers and make the best assortment, merchandising, pricing, and promotional
choices, in their various physical and online sales channels. We build tailored
Augmented Intelligence solutions to meet clients’ priority challenges and serve
their strategies by supporting their teams in change management, defining
together the best KPIs to meet clients’ challenges and adapt our solutions to
the client’s needs, constraints and processes. Moreover, this year, we have won
the “Pépite du Retail 2020” trophy, voted for by LSA Live participants and was
elected best Microsoft 2021 partner in the “France Action Startup Award”
category; we have nearly 50 colleagues vs. 25 in 2020.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211230-awards" src="/images/20211230-awards.png" />
</p>

<h3 id="what-did-i-do-during-working">What did I do during working?</h3>
<p>This year I accomplished about twenty CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
projects, some are for the distributors, some are for the industrialists. With
our analysis, we help them to have 10% more turnover per client. I also
developed new features for a module that can extract about 50 KPIs for 1 year
for different levels, such as per product/store, per product category/store
group, or temporal levels x product/store, like month x product or day x store,
etc. The SLA (Service-Level Agreement) of this module is about 2-5 min, and
during 2 weeks after the release, the module has already been used around 1500
times. Moreover, with my colleague, we created a model for estimating the
product’s turnover and recommend products for different promotion operations,
which will be applied in a new module. Since it’s confidential, I won’t talk
about the details here ;)</p>

<p>Furthermore, as the company expands, we updated our information on <a href="https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr/companies/memory">Welcome to
the Jungle</a>. I participated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwASE5f_7gA">video shooting</a> for
presenting what the data team does in daily work and how we cooperate with other
teams like consulting team and dev team.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-i-learn-during-working">What did I learn during working?</h3>
<p>Working in different projects of retailing, I gained more knowledge of <a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/multiple-kpis-in-retailing-1/">different</a>
<a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/multiple-kpis-in-retailing-2/">indicactors</a>. Thanks to the CRM projects, I understand what should we
focus on according to clients’ needs and <a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/crm-in-retailing/">how to segment customers with their purchases</a>.
During the daily work, I learned how to cut a project and accomplish different
parts of the project with colleagues. The biggest gain is that when I did the
sales promotion project, I enriched my knowledge of promotion, I understood
different promotions operate different mechanics and generosities; to define
the products for each promotion, we need to reach various objectives, such as
the turnover objective, product number, brand type distribution, generosity
distribution, etc. Thanks to this project, I have closer contact with the people
of business (category managers, purchase, promotion, etc.), which let me better
understand their needs/pain points, so that we can develop the right product to
satisfy the needs or solve the pain points.</p>

<h2 id="covid-19-vaccine-analysis">COVID-19 vaccine analysis</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with
the COVID-19 virus, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. To
achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be
vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of
social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped.
And a vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much
wisdom and effort of scientists.</p>

<p>With open-source datasets, I analyzed the adverse reactions of Pfizer vaccine,
Coronavac vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine and Modena vaccine in different blogs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-reactions/">Do you know the reactions of Pfizer vaccine?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/coronavac-covid-19-vaccine-reactions/">Do you know the reactions of Coronavac vaccine?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/astrazeneca-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-reactions/">Do you know the reactions of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-reactions/">Do you know the reactions of Modena vaccine?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/four-covid-19-vaccines-reactions/">Do you know which COVID-19 vaccine brings the most obvious reactions?</a></li>
</ul>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211030-global-comparaison" src="/images/20211030-global-comparaison.png" />
</p>

<p>Whether it is a local reaction or a systemic reaction, the reaction is most
obvious after the injection of Modena. 86% of people have local reactions, such
as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site, and nearly 67% have a
systemic reaction. Such as fatigue, chills, joint pain, muscle pain, etc.
Followed by the Kexing vaccine, 62% of people had a local reaction after
injection, and 58% had a systemic reaction. Among the four vaccines, the
Pfizer-Biotech vaccine caused the least adverse reactions. The probability of
local and systemic reactions after vaccination was 29.5% and 22.4%, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="blogs">Blogs</h2>
<p>This year I wrote 22 blogs (including this one), they talk about various topics:
retailing, COVID-19, population and employee. Moreover, the traffic of my blog
increased by 21.4% concerning 2020. I’m pretty glad if my blogs can help you and
solve the problems for you.</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Blog traffic 2" src="/images/20211230-blog2.png" />
</p>

<p>Besides, I opened a Wechat Official Account, which is likely a personal blog
based on Wechat. On this platform, I translated some of my English blogs into
Chinese ones and shared them with my Chinese friends. I’ve written 11 blogs
and they’ve been read for 8500 times.</p>

<p>Don’t hesitate if you want to ask questions or write comments, it’s welcome!!</p>

<p>Hope to see you in 2022!</p>

<p>People who are familiar with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openpyxl</code> know that we can use it to read/write
Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files. As I presented in <a href="https://jingwen-z.github.io/how-to-munipulate-excel-workbook-by-python/">this blog</a>,
we can create a workbook, assign values to some cells, apply number formats,
merge cells, etc. However, if we need to create an Excel dashboard as the
following, should we accomplish all formats with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openpyxl</code>?</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211127-portfolio-dashboard" src="/images/20211127-portfolio-dashboard.png" />
</p>

<p>For the question above, we can resolve it from another point of view: we can
create an Excel template with the fixed format, such as dashboard title and logo,
subtitles, then write values into this template. In this blog, I’ll show you how
to do this with the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Context</li>
  <li>Write data into the template</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>We have an Excel template named “template.xlsx”, which contains two worksheets
“category” and “product”:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211127-category-template" src="/images/20211127-category-template.png" />
</p>

<p>The worksheet “category” shows the performance of each category with different
indicators like turnover, volume, number of clients, etc.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211127-product-template" src="/images/20211127-product-template.png" />
</p>

<p>The worksheet “product” shows the performance of each product with the same
indicators.</p>

<p>And what we need to insert into these two worksheets are three pandas dataframes:
classic_indicators_df, other_indicators_df and products_detail_df.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211127-category-df" src="/images/20211127-category-df.PNG" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211127-product-df" src="/images/20211127-product-df.PNG" />
</p>

<h2 id="write-data-into-the-template">Write data into the template</h2>
<p>With all data preparation, the next target is writing the three dataframes into
the template with several steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load the workbook</li>
  <li>Create a writer</li>
  <li>Write dataframe into the template</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="load-the-workbook">Load the workbook</h3>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">template</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">openpyxl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">load_workbook</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'./template.xlsx'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We load the template with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openpyxl.load_workbook</code> by indicating the path.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-writer">Create a writer</h3>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pd</span>

<span class="n">out_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'./final_report.xlsx'</span>

<span class="n">writer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ExcelWriter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">out_path</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">writer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">template</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We set the writer with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas.ExcelWriter</code> that allows to write DataFrame
objects into excel sheets, and set the template file as the writer’s workbook.</p>

<h3 id="write-dataframe-into-the-template">Write dataframe into the template</h3>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles.borders import Border, Side
import string

def set_border(ws, cell_range):
    rows = ws[cell_range]
    side = Side(border_style='thin', color="FF000000")

    rows = list(rows)
    max_y = len(rows) - 1  # index of the last row
    for pos_y, cells in enumerate(rows):
        max_x = len(cells) - 1  # index of the last cell
        for pos_x, cell in enumerate(cells):
            border = Border(
                left=cell.border.left,
                right=cell.border.right,
                top=cell.border.top,
                bottom=cell.border.bottom
            )
            border.left = side
            border.right = side
            border.top = side
            border.bottom = side
            
            cell.border = border
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Before writing into the template, I create a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set_border()</code> by using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Side()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Border()</code> to set borders for each cell in the given range.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>df_sheet_list = [(classic_indicators_df, 'category'),

for (df, sht) in df_sheet_list:
    templ_sht = template[sht]
    writer.sheets = {templ_sht.title:templ_sht}

    if df is classic_indicators_df:
        classic_indicators_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=sht, index=False,
                                       header=False, startrow=13, startcol=2)
        set_border(writer.sheets[sht], f"C14:G{14-1+len(df)}")
    elif df is other_indicators_df:
        other_indicators_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=sht, index=False,

        set_border(writer.sheets[sht], f"E13:K{13-1+len(df)}")

writer.save()
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We assign the sheet where we will insert the dateframe to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writer.sheets</code>.
Then we write the dataframe with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.to_excel</code> by specifying the writer we use,
the worksheet that we want to insert, and the start row and the start column
with integers, after all these steps, we save the file with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writer.save()</code>.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with the COVID-19 virus, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. In order to achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped. And a vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort of scientists. Last time, I analyzed the adverse reactions of Pfizer vaccine, Coronavac vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine and Modena vaccine. Today we will compare the side effects of different vaccines in a longitudinal direction.</p>

<p>Before starting, introduce the following two terms that will be frequently mentioned next:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Local reaction: A reaction that occurs at the entrance of an infected organism or injection.</li>
  <li>Systemic reaction: When inflammation spreads from a local area of ​​an organ (such as the skin) to other organ systems in the body, it is called a systemic reaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-background">Data background</h2>
<h3 id="coronavac-vaccine">Coronavac vaccine</h3>
<p>Instituto Butantan (Instituto Butantan) announced the final results of the Phase III clinical trial of the COVID-19 vaccine of China Kexing Company in Brazil. From July 21 to December 16, 2020, 12842 participants were screened at 16 research sites in Brazil, and 12408 participants were randomly grouped. A total of 12396 participants received at least one dose of Coronavac vaccine or placebo, including 6195 in the vaccine group and 6201 in the placebo group. Among the 12396 participants, 5.1% were elderly participants 60 years or older, 64.2% were women, and most of the participants claimed to be white (75.3%). More than half of the participants (55.9%) had underlying diseases, of which 22.5% were obese (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2). The average age and BMI of the participants were 39.5 years and 26.8 kg/m2, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="modena-vaccine">Modena vaccine</h3>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released data on the response and severity of people of different ages after being vaccinated with Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine. As of November 11, 2020, 30350 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio, with a median follow-up period of 7 weeks after the second vaccination. 75.2% of the participants in the vaccine group were between 18 and 65 years old, 47.8% were women; 79% were white, 10% were black or African American, and 4.3% were Asian participants. The median age is 53 years. 27% of the participants had underlying diseases, and 5% had major heart diseases.</p>

<h3 id="pfizer-biontech-vaccine">Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine</h3>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released data on the response and severity of populations of different ages after being vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Data for people over 18 years old: As of November 14, 2020, 43252 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio, and the median follow-up time was 2 months after the second vaccination. They included 49.4% of women, 81.9% of whites, 9.8% of African Americans, 4.4% of Asian participants and &lt;3% of other ethnic groups; 26.2% of participants were Hispanic/Latino; 21.4% Participants are &gt;65 years old. The median age is 51 years. The most frequently reported comorbidities were obesity (35.1%), diabetes (with or without chronic complications, 8.4%) and lung disease (7.8%). Geographically, 76.7% of the participants are from the United States, 15.3% are from Argentina, 6.1% are from Brazil, and 2% are from South Africa.
Data on people aged 12-15: On April 9, 2021, Pfizer-Biotech supplemented the test results of people aged 12-15 and stated that the vaccine can be used in this group. 2260 adolescents aged 12-15 were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a ratio of 1:1, with a median follow-up period of 2 months after the second vaccination. They included 49.3% of women, 88.0% of whites, 7.7% of African Americans, 2.4% of Asians, and &lt;2% of other ethnic groups; 10.5% of participants were Hispanic/Latino. The median age is 14 years. 21.5% of participants had one or more comorbidities that would increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Geographically, all participants live in the United States.</p>

<h3 id="astrazeneca-vaccine">AstraZeneca vaccine</h3>
<p>Data released by the AstraZeneca vaccine trial group at the University of Oxford. From May 30 to August 8, 2020, 560 participants were included in the study and randomly assigned to the experimental vaccine group or the control vaccine group: 160 participants between the ages of 18-55 (100 assigned To ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 were assigned to MenACWY), 160 were 56-69 years old (120 were assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 40 were assigned to MenACWY) and 240 were 70 years and older (200 were assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19, 40 were assigned to MenACWY).</p>

<h2 id="the-most-obvious-reaction-after-the-injection-of-modena">The most obvious reaction after the injection of Modena</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211030-global-comparaison" src="/images/20211030-global-comparaison.png" />
</p>

<p>Whether it is a local reaction or a systemic reaction, the reaction is most obvious after the injection of Modena. 86% of people have local reactions, such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site, and nearly 67% have a systemic reaction. Such as fatigue, chills, joint pain, muscle pain, etc. Followed by the Kexing vaccine, 62% of people had a local reaction after injection, and 58% had a systemic reaction. Among the four vaccines, the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine caused the least adverse reactions. The probability of local and systemic reactions after vaccination was 29.5% and 22.4%, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="all-4-vaccines-are-easy-to-cause-pain-and-chills-at-the-injection-site">All 4 vaccines are easy to cause pain and chills at the injection site</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211030-local-reactions-comparaison" src="/images/20211030-local-reactions-comparaison.png" />
</p>

<p>Among the four vaccines, pain at the injection site is the most prone to local reaction, especially after the injection of Modena or Pfizer-Biotech vaccine, the probability of this reaction is as high as 70%-85%. The possibility of swelling and redness is much lower, and none of the 4 vaccines is higher than 10%.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-1" src="/images/20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-1.png" />
</p>

<p>For fatigue, chills and joint pain, the probability of the above three systemic reactions after the first injection of AstraZeneca vaccine is higher than the other three vaccines (fatigue: 56%, chills: 17%, joint pain: 22%), but the probability of adverse reactions after the second shot of Modena vaccine is the highest among the four vaccines (fatigue: 65%, chills: 44%, arthralgia: 43%).</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-2" src="/images/20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-2.png" />
</p>

<p>The data released by the AstraZeneca vaccine trial group at the University of Oxford did not mention the adverse reaction of headache, but the probability of headache caused by the other three COVID-19 vaccines is still higher, especially the second dose of Modena or Pfizer- After the biotech vaccine, there is a 50% chance of headache. However, 10%-20% of people feel nausea/vomiting after being vaccinated with AstraZeneca. There is a similar situation with Modena vaccine. On the contrary, people who have received Pfizer-Biotech vaccine are less than 2% likely to have the same Reaction. Instituto Butantan, Brazil’s Instituto Butantan, announced that the Coronavac COVID-19 vaccine in the final study results of Brazil’s Phase III clinical trial did not mention the fever response. After the second shot of the other three vaccines, 10% There is a -15% probability of having a fever.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-3" src="/images/20211030-sys-reactions-comparaison-3.png" />
</p>

<p>Similarly, the data released by the AstraZeneca vaccine trial group at the University of Oxford did not mention the adverse reactions of muscle pain and diarrhea. The data on the reaction and severity of the COVID-19 vaccine also did not mention the reaction of diarrhea. However, after vaccination with Modena and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, more than 20% of people will feel muscle pain, especially after the second dose of Modena, the proportion is close to 60%.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination">What should I pay attention to after vaccination?</h2>
<p>Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods, seafood foods, and drinking alcohol. It is recommended to drink plenty of water (source: Zhihu)</li>
  <li>Try to avoid strenuous exercise and keep adequate rest (source: Zhihu)</li>
  <li>Measures should be taken to protect yourself and others during travel (Source: CDC)</li>
  <li>You should still pay attention to the symptoms of COVID-19, especially when you are with patients. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should be tested and self-isolate, away from others (Source: CDC)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, in clinical trials, at least 40% of people will feel pain at the injection site regardless of the first or second injection, and at least 30% may feel tired or headache, especially if they have been vaccinated with Modena or Pfizer. -After the biotech vaccine.</p>

<p>After vaccination, you should pay attention to the light diet and keep adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.</p>

And a vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort of scientists. Last time, I analyzed the adverse reactions of Pfizer vaccine, Coronavac vaccine and AstraZeneca vaccine, and my friends wanted to know the side effects of Modena vaccine.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released data on the response and severity of people of different ages after being vaccinated with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Today, I will take you to learn more about the specific information. Before starting, introduce the following two terms that will be frequently mentioned next:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Local reaction: A reaction that occurs at the entrance of an infected organism or injection.</li>
  <li>Systemic reaction: When inflammation spreads from a local area of ​​an organ (such as the skin) to other organ systems in the body, it is called a systemic reaction.</li>

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210920-underlying-disease" src="/images/20210920-underlying-disease.png" />
</p>

<p>As of November 11, 2020, 30,350 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio, with a median follow-up period of 7 weeks after the second vaccination. 75.2% of the participants in the vaccine group were between 18 and 65 years old, 47.8% were women; 79% were white, 10% were black or African American, and 4.3% were Asian participants. The median age is 53 years. 27% of the participants had underlying diseases, and 5% had major heart diseases.</p>

<h2 id="pain-at-the-injection-site-is-most-common">Pain at the injection site is most common</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210920-local-reactions" src="/images/20210920-local-reactions.png" />
</p>

<p>Among the local reactions, pain at the injection site is a common adverse reaction of all ages, and it is most obvious after the second injection, especially for people aged 18-64 years old, the probability of occurrence is as high as 90%; compared to the pain at the injection site, redness The odds are much lower, less than 10%.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210920-sys-reactions" src="/images/20210920-sys-reactions.png" />
</p>

<p>Among the systemic reactions, the overall probability of adverse reactions after the second injection is higher than that of the first injection, or even doubled. The more common ones are fatigue, headache and muscle pain; it is worth noting that the same adverse reactions As age increases, the probability of occurrence decreases. For example, among 18-64-year-olds, 68% of people will feel fatigued after the second injection, but for people 65 and older, this ratio drops to 58 %.</p>

<h2 id="different-people-have-different-levels-of-sensitivity">Different people have different levels of sensitivity</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210920-local-reactions-detail" src="/images/20210920-local-reactions-detail.png" />
</p>

<p>About 80% of people will experience mild or moderate pain at the injection site, and 10%-15% will experience mild or moderate axillary swelling/tenderness.
In addition, 4%-6% of people have slight or moderate swelling at the injection site after the first injection, and this proportion rises to 10%-12% after the second injection.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210920-sys-reactions-details-1" src="/images/20210920-sys-reactions-details-1.png" />
</p>

<p>30%-40% of people will feel mild or moderate fatigue after the first injection. After the second injection, this proportion rises to 50%-60%, and there is a 10% probability of severe fatigue. .</p>

<p>In a similar situation, there is the symptom of headache. The difference is that the probability of severe headache is 3%-5%.</p>

<p>In addition, about 5%-10% of people will feel mild or moderate chills after the first injection. The proportion of people aged 18-64 after the second injection rises to 48%. For 65-year-olds About 30% of people and above feel mild or moderate chills after the second shot.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210920-sys-reactions-details-2" src="/images/20210920-sys-reactions-details-2.png" />
</p>

<p>About 20% of people will feel mild or moderate muscle pain after the first injection. After the second injection, this proportion rises to 40%-50%, and there is a 5%-10% probability that it will be severe. Fatigue.</p>

<p>The probability of joint pain is slightly lower than that of muscle pain. The probability of mild or moderate joint pain after the first shot is less than 20%, but after the second shot, the probability increases greatly, especially for people aged 18-64. One proportion doubles to 40%; and there is a 3%-6% probability that there will be severe joint pain.</p>

<p>Compared with the above adverse reactions, the probability of nausea or vomiting is not so high. After the first injection, there is a 5%-10% probability of feeling mild or moderate nausea or vomiting. This probability rises to 10%-20% after the second injection.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination">What should I pay attention to after vaccination?</h2>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, in clinical trials, regardless of the first or second needle, there is about 80% probability that the injection site will feel pain, and there is a 35%-60% probability that you will feel fatigue or headache. After the second injection, the feeling will be more obvious than the first injection, but most of them are mild or moderate.</p>

<p>After vaccination, you should pay attention to the light diet and keep adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with the COVID-19 virus, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. In order to achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped. And a vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort of scientists. Last time, I analyzed the adverse reactions of Pfizer vaccine and Coronavac vaccine, and my friends wanted to know the side effects of AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>

<p>Today, I will borrow the data released by the AstraZeneca Vaccine Trial Group at the University of Oxford to show you the specific information. Before starting, introduce the following two terms that will be frequently mentioned next:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Local reaction: A reaction that occurs at the entrance of an infected organism or injection.</li>
  <li>Systemic reaction: When inflammation spreads from a local area of ​​an organ (such as the skin) to other organ systems in the body, it is called a systemic reaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-background">Data background</h2>
<p>From May 30 to August 8, 2020, 560 participants were included in the study and randomly assigned to the experimental vaccine group or the control vaccine group: 160 participants between the ages of 18-55 (100 assigned To ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 were assigned to MenACWY), 160 were 56-69 years old (120 were assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 40 were assigned to MenACWY) and 240 were 70 years and older (200 were assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19, 40 were assigned to MenACWY).</p>

<p>18-55 years old population data: They include 47% of women, 82% of white people, 14% of Asian participants and 4% of other ethnic groups. The median age is 39 years. 92% were drinkers, 36% of participants had underlying diseases, and 20% had respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>Data for 56-69-year-olds: They include 53% of women, 87% of whites and 13% of Asian participants. The median age is 59.5 years. 97% were alcohol drinkers and 0 smokers. 23% of the participants had underlying diseases and 13% had cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Data for people over 70 years old: 43% of them are women, and all participants are white. The median age is 73 years. 86% were drinkers and 0 smokers. 41% of the participants had underlying diseases and 27% had cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<h2 id="tenderness-and-fatigue-are-the-most-common">Tenderness and fatigue are the most common</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-local-reactions-18-55" src="/images/20210820-local-reactions-18-55.png" />

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-local-reactions-70plus" src="/images/20210820-local-reactions-70plus.png" />
</p>

<p>Among the local reactions, tenderness and pain at the injection site are common adverse reactions of all ages, and they are most obvious after the first injection, especially for people aged 18-55 years old, the probability of occurrence is as high as 60%; compared to the pain at the injection site, The chance of itching and redness is much lower, less than 10%. In addition, people over the age of 70 have less than 5% of the possibility of swelling or induration after vaccination.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-sys-reactions-18-55" src="/images/20210820-sys-reactions-18-55.png" />

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-sys-reactions-70plus" src="/images/20210820-sys-reactions-70plus.png" />
</p>

<p>Among the systemic reactions, the overall risk of adverse reactions after the first injection is higher than that after the second injection. The more common ones are fatigue, headache and muscle pain. It is worth noting that the same adverse reactions increase with age. The probability of occurrence will be reduced. For example, among 18-55-year-olds, 75% of people will feel tired after the first injection, but for 56-69-year-olds, this proportion drops to 50%, and for 70-year-olds For the above population, this proportion is reduced to 41%.</p>

<h2 id="different-people-have-different-levels-of-sensitivity">Different people have different levels of sensitivity</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-local-reactions-detail" src="/images/20210820-local-reactions-detail.png" />
</p>

<p>More than half of the population will experience mild tenderness, and about 60% of the 18-55-year-old population will experience mild or moderate pain at the injection site.</p>

<p>People aged 18-55 are the most sensitive to slight pain at the injection site. Especially at the first injection, more than 40% of them will feel slightly fatigued. This ratio is twice that of people over 70 years old. In addition, the injection site is suffering Almost all people suffering from pain are between 18-55 years old.</p>

<p>For itching, although the probability of occurrence is much lower than the first two, there are still 10% of people aged 18-55 who will feel moderate itching after the second injection.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-sys-reactions-details-1" src="/images/20210820-sys-reactions-details-1.png" />
</p>

<p>More than 30% of people will feel slight fatigue regardless of the first or second injection. Among them, 56-69-year-olds are most sensitive to slight fatigue after the second injection. In addition, more than 20% of people aged 18-55 will experience moderate fatigue.</p>

<p>For headaches, the most common degree is mild headaches, and people aged 56-69 are the most sensitive to this. The probability of occurrence after the first injection is as high as 50%, but after the second injection, this proportion is reduced to 30% .</p>

<p>People over 18 years of age have a 20% chance of experiencing mild muscle pain after vaccination. In the trial, no people over 56 years of age felt moderate or more severe muscle pain, but about 20% of people aged 18-55 would have Feel moderate muscle pain.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-sys-reactions-details-2" src="/images/20210820-sys-reactions-details-2.png" />
</p>

<p>After the first vaccination, 25% of the 18-55-year-old people will feel moderate discomfort, and those over 56 years old will have a 20% chance of feeling mild discomfort; after the second vaccination, the proportion of moderate discomfort will decrease. To about 5%, but there are still 20% of 18-55-year-old people feel mild discomfort.</p>

<p>For fever, people aged 18-55 have a 40% chance of experiencing mild, moderate or severe fever. This proportion is greatly reduced to 10% after the second injection; in addition, people over 56 years old will also have 10% chance of feeling mild fever.</p>

<p>Among people aged 18-55, the probability of joint pain is about 30%, especially after the first vaccination; for people over 56 years old, there is a 17% chance of feeling mild joint pain.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-sys-reactions-details-3" src="/images/20210820-sys-reactions-details-3.png" />
</p>

<p>Among 18-55-year-olds, the probability of getting chills after the first shot is about 40%, and this rate is reduced to 14% after the second shot; people over 56 years old are not very sensitive to chills, only 10% Possibility.</p>

<p>After the first shot, about 27% of people aged 18-55 will feel nauseous, and after the second shot, this proportion drops to 8%; people aged 56-69 have a 13% chance of feeling slightly nauseous, on the contrary However, this proportion increased to 21% after the second shot.</p>

<h2 id="are-astrazenecas-adverse-reactions-really-big">Are AstraZeneca’s adverse reactions really big?</h2>
<p>King’s College London, Harvard Medical School and other units published an article on adverse reactions after injection of the COVID-19 vaccine on Lancet Infect Dis on April 21, 2021, which compared the different adverse effects after vaccination with Pfizer and AstraZeneca reaction. Let’s compare them below.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-local-reactions-pfizerVSaz" src="/images/20210820-local-reactions-pfizerVSaz.png" />
</p>

<p>In terms of local reactions, the first shot of AstraZeneca was not as severe as the first shot of Pfizer vaccine, especially the second shot of Pfizer. For some local reactions, the second injection of Pfizer is much more likely to occur than AstraZeneca, such as pain at the injection site (34.26% vs. 19.1%), swelling (9.75% vs. 5.5%), redness (7.23%) vs. 4.18%) etc.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210820-sys-reactions-pfizerVSaz" src="/images/20210820-sys-reactions-pfizerVSaz.png" />
</p>

<p>But if we look at the systemic reaction, the reaction to the first shot of AstraZeneca is more severe than the second shot of Pfizer, even if compared with the second shot of Pfizer: the probability of fatigue and headache is higher than that of the second shot of Pfizer by 7%-10 %, the chance of chills and shaking is more than double that of Pfizer (6.42% vs. 14.70%).</p>

<h2 id="vaccination-with-astrazeneca--thrombosis">Vaccination with AstraZeneca = Thrombosis?</h2>
<p>In February 2021, two Austrian women suffered from coagulation disorders after being vaccinated with the vaccine. One of them died and the other was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism. Although the connection between blood clots and vaccination was not yet established, people have naturally regarded blood clots as one of the side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine. But is this really the case? How high is the chance of thrombosis?</p>

<p>In the“<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/16-04-2021-global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety-(gacvs)-review-of-latest-evidence-of-rare-adverse-blood-coagulation-events-with-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-(vaxzevria-and-covishield)">Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) review of latest evidence of rare adverse blood coagulation events with AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine (Vaxzevria and Covishield)</a>”published by the World Health Organization , it was mentioned that according to the latest available data, the AstraZeneca vaccine caused The risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome appears to be very low. Data from the United Kingdom shows that there are about 4 cases per million adults (1 case per 250,000 people) vaccinated, while the EU estimates the ratio is about 1 case per 100,000 people. Luo Yijun, deputy head of the medical response team of the Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center, said in mid-March that the incidence of thrombosis in Europeans and Americans is 5 to 10 times that of the yellow race.</p>

<p>Some investigators have investigated the age distribution of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome. The Global Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee supports further research to understand age-related risks, because although existing data indicate that young people are at higher risk, further analysis is needed. Regarding the issue of gender-related risks, although more cases have been reported among women, it must be emphasized that more women are vaccinated, and some cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome have also been reported among men.</p>

<p>There are four other categories of people, including those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation abnormalities, and women who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant, etc., should first assess the benefits and risks before deciding whether to vaccinate. (Source: BBC)</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination">What should I pay attention to after vaccination?</h2>
<p>Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods, seafood foods, and drinking alcohol. It is recommended to drink plenty of water (source: Zhihu)</li>
  <li>Try to avoid strenuous exercise and keep adequate rest (source: Zhihu)</li>
  <li>Measures should be taken to protect yourself and others during travel (Source: CDC)</li>
  <li>You should still pay attention to the symptoms of COVID-19, especially when you are with patients. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should be tested and self-isolate, away from others (Source: CDC)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the whole, in clinical trials, regardless of the first or second needle, there is a 60% probability that the injection site will feel tenderness, and there is a 30%-50% probability that you will feel tired or headache. After the second injection, the feeling will not be as obvious as the first injection. In addition, considering that there are not many test samples, the credibility of the data needs to be confirmed.</p>

<p>After vaccination, you should pay attention to the lightness of your diet and maintain adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with COVID-19, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. To achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped. A vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort from scientists. Among Chinese vaccines, the most familiar one is Coronavac vaccine, but do you know its adverse reactions?</p>

<p>Instituto Butantan announced the final results of the Phase III clinical trial of China’s Coronavac COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil. Today, I will take you to learn more about the specific information.</p>

<h2 id="instituto-butantan">Instituto Butantan</h2>
<p>Before starting the text, let’s get a general understanding of the Basilis Butantan Institute: It is the largest immunobiology and biopharmaceutical manufacturer in Latin America (and one of the largest in the world), and is considered to be the world’s main science One of the centers. It is world-famous for collecting venomous snakes as well as venomous lizards, spiders, insects and scorpions. By extracting the venom of reptiles and insects, the institute has developed antivenoms and drugs against many diseases, including tuberculosis, rabies, tetanus and diphtheria.</p>

<h2 id="authorization">Authorization</h2>
<p>Liu Peicheng, Director of Branding and Public Relations of Kexing, said that Kexing’s COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for use in nearly 30 countries and regions, including China, Chile, Brazil, and Turkey, including emergency use, conditional listing or official listing, and has been launched one after another. Large-scale vaccination work. As of April 21, 2021, a total of 160 million doses have been vaccinated globally, including China. The World Health Organization (WHO) approved the emergency use of Kexing COVID-19 vaccine on June 1, 2021.</p>

<h2 id="data-background">Data background</h2>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210715-underlying-disease" src="/images/20210715-underlying-disease.png" />
</p>

<p>From July 21 to December 16, 2020, 12842 participants were screened at 16 research sites in Brazil, and 12408 participants were randomly grouped. A total of 12396 participants received at least one dose of Coxing vaccine or placebo, including 6195 in the vaccine group and 6,201 in the placebo group. Among the 12396 participants, 5.1% were elderly participants 60 years or older, 64.2% were women, and most of the participants claimed to be white (75.3%). More than half of the participants (55.9%) had underlying diseases, of which 22.5% were obese (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2). The average age and BMI of the participants were 39.5 years and 26.8 kg/m2, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="most-adverse-reactions-will-occur-within-7-days-of-vaccination">Most adverse reactions will occur within 7 days of vaccination</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210715-global-1" src="/images/20210715-global-1.png" />
</p>

<p>Nearly 75% of adverse reactions occur within one week after vaccination, but adverse reactions occur within one hour after vaccination, but the probability is relatively low, about 7%.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210715-global-2" src="/images/20210715-global-2.png" />
</p>

<p>In the trial population, half of them had adverse reactions with different symptoms and different degrees, and the probability of local reactions (62%) was slightly higher than that of systemic reactions (58%).</p>

<p>Local reaction: A reaction that occurs at the entrance of an infected organism or injection.
Systemic reaction: When inflammation spreads from a local area of ​​an organ (such as the skin) to other organ systems in the body, it is called a systemic reaction.</p>

<h2 id="the-adverse-reactions-of-the-second-vaccination-were-milder-than-the-first">The adverse reactions of the second vaccination were milder than the first</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210715-common-local" src="/images/20210715-common-local.png" />
</p>

<p>Judging from the common reactions after the two inoculations, among the local reactions, the reaction of the second inoculation will be slightly more obvious than the first but the difference is not much. The most common reaction is still pain at the injection site. The probability of this reaction in the second injection has increased by 1.83% compared with the first time. It is also the most likely increase in the probability of these five local reactions. In addition to the above-mentioned common adverse reactions, there are some reactions that will occur with a very small probability. For example, after the first dose of vaccination, there is a 0.1% probability of fever and a 0.06% probability of localized rash. After the second injection, the probability of hardening of the inoculation site, exfoliation of the epidermis, or pustules was less than 0.05%.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210715-common-systemic" src="/images/20210715-common-systemic.png" />
</p>

<p>Judging from the common reaction after the two vaccination, in the systemic reaction, the reaction of the second vaccination was mostly weaker than that of the first vaccination. Especially for “headache”, “fatigue” and “nausea”, their chances of appearing decreased by 6.54%, 4.78% and 2% respectively. With regard to vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, skin rashes, blushing and other adverse reactions, the probability of occurrence is less than 1%. In addition to the above-mentioned common adverse reactions, there are some reactions that will occur with a very small probability. For example, after the first dose of vaccination, there is a 0.42% probability of back pain, 0.26% of oral herpes, 0.19% probability of hyperhidrosis, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, muscle weakness, heart palpitations, etc. less than 1% will occur reaction. After the second injection, there is a 0.46% chance of limb pain, a 0.33% chance of breathing difficulties, a 0.11% chance of edema, and tachycardia, anxiety, pharyngitis, and other reactions less than 1%.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-pay-attention-to-after-vaccination">What should I pay attention to after vaccination?</h2>
<p>Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid eating spicy and irritating foods, seafood foods, and drinking alcohol. It is recommended to drink plenty of water (source: Zhihu)</li>
  <li>Try to avoid strenuous exercise and keep adequate rest (source: Zhihu)</li>
  <li>Measures should still be taken to protect yourself and others during travel (Source: CDC)</li>
  <li>You should still pay attention to the symptoms of COVID-19, especially when you are with patients. If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, you should be tested and self-isolate, stay away from others (Source: CDC)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the whole, in clinical trials, regardless of the first or second needle, there is a 45% probability that the injection site will feel pain, and there is a 20%-30% probability that you will feel tired or headache. After the second injection, the feeling will not be as obvious as the first injection.</p>

<p>After vaccination, you should pay attention to the light diet and keep adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2020, people from all over the world have struggled with COVID-19, and scientists are also actively looking for solutions. To achieve herd immunity, the most effective method at the moment can be said to be vaccination. Various voices about the vaccine have also been on the cusp of social public opinion, and the praise or controversy about it has never stopped. A vaccine from theoretical design to clinical trials requires too much wisdom and effort from scientists. Among so many vaccines, the most familiar one is the Pfizer vaccine, but do you know its adverse reactions?</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released data on the response and degree of the population of different ages after being vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech. Today, I will take you to learn more about the specific information.</p>

<h2 id="data-background">Data background</h2>
<p>The study published experimental data for people of different age groups: one group was an adult group (more than 18 years old), and the other group was a teenager group (12-15 years old).</p>

<p>Data for people over 18 years old: As of November 14, 2020, 43,252 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio, and the median follow-up time was 2 months after the second vaccination. They included 49.4% of women, 81.9% of whites, 9.8% of African Americans, 4.4% of Asian participants and &lt;3% of other ethnic groups; 26.2% of participants were Hispanic/Latino; 21.4% Participants are &gt;65 years old. The median age is 51 years. The most frequently reported comorbidities were obesity (35.1%), diabetes (with or without chronic complications, 8.4%) and lung disease (7.8%). Geographically, 76.7% of the participants are from the United States, 15.3% are from Argentina, 6.1% are from Brazil, and 2% are from South Africa.</p>

<p>Data on people aged 12-15: On April 9, 2021, Pfizer-Biotech supplemented the test results of people aged 12-15 and stated that the vaccine can be used in this group. 2260 adolescents aged 12-15 were randomly assigned to the vaccine or placebo group at a ratio of 1:1, with a median follow-up period of 2 months after the second vaccination. They included 49.3% of women, 88.0% of whites, 7.7% of African Americans, 2.4% of Asians, and &lt;2% of other ethnic groups; 10.5% of the participants were Hispanic/Latino. The median age is 14 years. 21.5% of participants had one or more comorbidities that would increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Geographically, all participants live in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="pain-at-the-injection-site-is-most-common">Pain at the injection site is most common</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210701-global-reactions1" src="/images/20210701-global-reactions1.png" />
</p>

<p>Among the local reactions, pain at the injection site is a common adverse reaction of all ages, and it is most obvious after the first injection, especially for people aged 12-55 years old, the probability of occurrence is as high as 80%; compared to the pain at the injection site, the probability of swelling and redness is much lower, which is less than 10%.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210701-global-reactions2" src="/images/20210701-global-reactions2.png" />
</p>

<p>Among the systemic reactions, the overall probability of adverse reactions after the second injection is higher than that of the first injection. The more common ones are fatigue, headache and muscle pain. It is worth noting that the probability of the same adverse reactions occurrence will be reduced with age increasing. For example, among people aged 12-15, 60% will feel fatigued after the first injection, but for people aged 18-55, this proportion drops to 47%, and for people aged &gt; 55-year-olds, this proportion is reduced to 34%.</p>

<h2 id="different-people-have-different-levels-of-sensitivity">Different people have different levels of sensitivity</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210701-detail-reactions-1" src="/images/20210701-detail-reactions-1.png" />
</p>

<p>Here, “Mild” means not affecting daily activities, “Moderate” means beginning to affect daily activities, “Severe” means hindering daily activities, and “Grade 4” means going to the emergency room or hospitalized due to severe pain at the injection site.</p>

<p>Nearly half of people over the age of 18 will experience mild pain at the injection site, and about 80% of people aged 12-15 will experience mild or moderate pain at the injection site.</p>

<p>People aged 12-15 are most sensitive to mild fatigue, especially during the second injection, 40% of them will feel slightly fatigued, which is twice the proportion of people over 18 years old; but people over 18 years old feel moderate fatigue more easily than people aged 12-15, especially those aged 18-55, which have a 35% probability that they will feel moderately fatigued after the second injection.</p>

<p>For headaches, the most common degree is a moderate headache. Among people aged 12-15, 22.3% have a moderate headache after the first injection, but the proportion of people experiencing a moderate headache after the second injection has risen to 35%. A similar situation also appeared in people over the age of 18, 19.2% of people had a moderate headache after the first injection, but after the second injection, this proportion rose to 36%.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="20210701-detail-reactions-2" src="/images/20210701-detail-reactions-2.png" />
</p>

<p>Here, “Mild” means not affecting daily activities, “Moderate” means beginning to affect daily activities, “Severe” means hindering daily activities, and “Grade 4” means going to the emergency room or hospitalized due to severe pain at the injection site.</p>

<p>The response of different age groups to different degrees of muscle pain is similar. About 5%-10% of people feel mild or moderate pain after the first injection. This proportion rises to 15%-20% after the second injection. People over the age of 18 who received the second shot of the vaccine are more sensitive to joint pain than those aged 12-15, and the probability of occurrence is doubled after the first shot.</p>

<p>Compared with muscle pain and joint pain, people aged 12-15 are more likely to feel chills. About 30% of them feel mild or moderate chills after the first injection, this proportion increased to 40% after the second injection. The same reaction is 14% and 33% for people aged 18-55, and it is even lower for people over 55: 6% and 22%.</p>

<p>Being vaccinated does not mean that everything will be well and that the virus will not invade. After observing, we still need to pay attention to some things:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the whole, in clinical trials, regardless of the first or the second dose, there is about 80% probability that the injection site will feel pain, and there is a 30%-50% probability that you will feel tired or headache. After the second injection, the feeling will be more obvious than the first injection, but it is mostly mild or moderate.</p>

<p>After vaccination, you should pay attention to the light diet and keep adequate rest. Even if you are vaccinated, you must pay attention to protection.</p>
