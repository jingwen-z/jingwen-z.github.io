Various manipulation with SQL query, such as:
- ISO calendar: When we create yearly, monthly or weekly report, we are
sometimes beset by problem about calendar. Like the last day of year 2018
(2018-12-31) is regarded as one day of 2018 or 2019 ? Or the last day of year
2018 is considered as one day of 2018’s last week or 2019’s first week? It’s a
question about ISO calendar, and the answer depends on what we want. In my blog,
I talked about how to handle ISO calendar with Teradata Database SQL.
- Data processing: we can take advantage of SQL query to improve `pandas`
dataframe processing performance.
