Data analysis with different visualisations on multiple topics, such as real
estate, climate, COVID-19.
- Airbnb Paris Analysis：Paris is the capital and most populous city of France,
and it also attracts lots of tourists, which makes me eager to dig out Airbnb
locations in Paris. Where are the locations located? What are their prices?
According to the analysis, we find that the majority of Airbnb locations in
Paris are entire home/apartment; most of the locations are location at
Buttes-Montmartre, Popincourt and Vaugirard; the most expensive locations are
located at Elysée, Palais-Bourbon and Louvre. Furthermore, in recent years,
Airbnb locations’ amount increases 102% in Paris, and locations’ average price
does not change that much in general.
- Forest area analysis: Human society and forests influence each other in both
positive and negative ways. Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and
serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people’s health. Human
activities, including harvesting forest resources, can negatively affect forest
ecosystems. Thus, only human protects forest so that forests will supply us
more and more pure air.
- COVID-19 analysis: The outbreak of the COVID-19 has been several months. The
initial outbreak has greatly affected China and other Asian countries. At the
beginning of March, China reached its peak of COVID-19 pandemic for the first
stage. After March, the COVID-19’s proliferation spread to other countries
around the world, especially in Europe and North America. By applying different
visualisation, I did several analysis for different continents, countries and cities.
