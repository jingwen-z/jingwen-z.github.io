Visualisation created by multiple modules of python or R. In my blogs:
- I talked about how to create various plots with `matplotlib` module of python,
such as scatter plot, treemap, venn diagram, area chart, radar chart, etc.
- I explained how to read and understand box plot.
- I applied multiple visualisations on different analytics topics, like climate
change, real estate, COVID-19, etc.
