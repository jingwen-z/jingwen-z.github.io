My blog introduces how to use `openpyxl` package to manipulate Microsoft Excel
workbook and worksheet, like create a workbook and worksheet, write values in
cells, set font(size, type, bold, italic), cut and paste values from one cell
to another, remove one row, merge cells, set number format, set cells'
background colors and center text in one cell, wrap text in one cell, reset
columns' width, set borders, hide grid, reset zoom scale, create named range
and save the workbook.
