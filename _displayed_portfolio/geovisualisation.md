Geovisualisation created by `folium` module of python. In my blogs:
- I talked about how to draw a variety of maps with `folium` module in Python,
such as displaying all locations with points / clusters, painting areas with
different colors, adding labels on the map, adding polygon borders, etc.
- I applied geovisualisation on different topics like real estate, climate
change and COVID-19.
